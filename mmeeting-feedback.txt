I need to really phrase it 

nothing looks over multiple artifacts ... 
it doens't come across that way


have separate techniques for each artifact type
but they require configuration
learning a project artifact 

different kinds of information 
which might be hard for a dev to use


two properties

1 - across artifact types
2 - the reason we want that is 

--- artifacts evolve
--- harder to deploy these techniques 




I want for related work

1 - how do people find information?
2 - but baiscally expand a set of artifacts 
---- this section sets the stage for people look into multiple places

what are the techniques out there that help with that ?

soft devs use a bunch of techniques 

here are the ones for SE


make the argument ending up 
there's actually more structure in related work 
 
 finding relevant passages in law documents 
 why web pages in a search result are different



 intro and related work --- may 3rd



---------------


Think about the work as a whole 
then what parts of it would you imagine pepole asking about 

challenges with deploying the technique 
limitations that came about looking at particular datasets  
looking at it in the long term 
what about other tasks
