\textbf{Study Purpose:} \medskip

The purpose of this study is to design a non-intrusive approach for identifying which parts of a natural language artifact are useful during a software development task so as to aid developers in finding information relevant to their tasks.

To accomplish this objective, we seek to investigate which text in non-source code artifacts software developers deem as relevant to a software task and whether text automatically identified and highlighted assists task completion.
 \medskip

\textbf{What you will be asked to do:} \medskip


This  is an online study, performed in a single session that will take no longer than 2 hours to complete. The study uses a web browser plug-in that allows you to select text deemed relevant to a software task and that automatically highlights text in certain web pages. The study is composed of an introductory session, a period in which you are asked to work on a set of tasks, and a follow-up survey.  \medskip

If you agree to participate in this study, we will provide you with a link to the web browser plug-in and installation instructions. After installation, you will have the opportunity to practice experimental procedures in a sample task. \medskip

In the second part, you will be asked to provide a solution in the form of written code for 2 software tasks. The tasks are drawn from Python online problems and require you to inspect reference documentation so that you can write your solution.  \medskip

For each task, you will have to read in any order that you wish their related documents and write your solution for that task. In the first task, we ask you to use the plug-in to manually select text that you consider relevant and that was helpful to reach your solution. For the second, the plug-in will automatically highlight text and, after completing the task, you must rate how helpful were the highlights shown.  \medskip

Completing a task is not mandatory and you will be allowed to work on each task for at most 50 minutes. You will proceed to the next task when you declare that you have finished your current task or after the 50 minutes mark. Please note that the quality of your code or time is not a determining factor, and we encourage you to work at your normal pace.  \medskip

When you finish your last assigned task, the final step in the experiment is an online survey that allows you to submit the text highlighted in the first task and that asks you to review how helpful was the text automatically highlighted in each document of the second task. \medskip

We will conclude each session debriefing the experiment, providing reference solutions for each task, and giving you the opportunity to enter a raffle for the prize advertised.
