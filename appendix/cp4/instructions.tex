{\large \textbf{Annotator Instructions}} \bigskip


Thank you for your interest in this annotation task. \bigskip
 
After answering some background questions, you will be prompted with 50 tasks and a varying number of links per task. You will be asked to select sentences deemed useful/important for task completion using a Google Chrome browser extension. \bigskip


To ease the annotation process,  tasks are divided into 5 batches, each containing 10 tasks. The number of links per task varies, but you will not find more than 5 links for any single task. A sample practice batch is included to help you get acclimatized with the tools and links you will find. \bigskip


Please, feel free to divide the work as best as it fits your schedule.
