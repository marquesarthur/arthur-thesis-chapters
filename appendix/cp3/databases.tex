{\large \textbf{Task: Databases}} \bigskip


Your software development team has just inherited a telecommunication customer retention system written in C. The system is responsible for creating and updating retention policies and computing
statistics about the success rate of several retention packages offered by the telecom company. The system uses procedural programming, and it was poorly designed. Hence, maintenance is costly and the
past development team could not handle the growing system's defects backlog. \medskip


Your team is tasked with migrating the system to an object-oriented programming language, i.e. Java. As part of the migration, you are responsible for the system's database layer abstraction. You consider either the adoption of an Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, such as Hibernate, or a Java Database Connectivity API (JDBC). As you assess using either Hibernate or JDBC, you consider performance,
code readability, and maintainability as driven factors in adopting one of them.  \medskip

The team emphasizes the necessity of test cases to ensure that the migration covered all corner case scenarios and the necessity to consistently manage database connections, as this was one of the major sources of defects in the past version. Since the Java community has thoughtfully discussed adopting one technology or another, you filtered a set of community discussions to assist with your decision.
