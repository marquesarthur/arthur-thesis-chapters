{\large \textbf{Task: Networking}} \bigskip


A collaborative bill-sharing system is being developed using Javascript and Node.js, particularly the
design team adopted React and restify as frameworks to facilitate their system's development. One of the
system's features requires that the users can create expenses to other users in a group. Whenever a new
bill is created, the receiver should be notified about the new expense. Likewise, the owner should be
notified about the bill payment. \medskip

As the developer responsible for the design of this feature, you evaluate whether Server-Sent Events
or WebSockets should be used to implement the notification system. As you assess the technologies,
you also consider browser's compatibility, simplicity, and performance as driven factors in the adoption of
one of them.

Which technology should be adopted for the development of the notification system?
