{\large \textbf{Task: GPMDPU}} \bigskip


You use the Google Play Music Desktop Player Unofficial (GPMDPU) for quite a while but you
have just migrated from the Linux OS to Mac OS. Now, you are having issues configuring the
system's shortcuts in the new OS, especially using the `cmd' key. You intend to submit a patch
fixing this issue, but prior to that, you turn to the system's official wiki and bug reports trying to
understand limitations about the GPMDPU shortcuts.
