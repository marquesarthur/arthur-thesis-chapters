\textbf{Study Purpose:} \medskip

The purpose of this study is to identify which parts of textual documents are useful during common programming tasks so as to automatically identify and aid developers in finding the relevant information in the documents. To accomplish this objective, we are investigating what information in non-source code artifacts are deemed as relevant to software development professionals when they are performing software activities that are likely to incur the inquiry of these artifacts. \medskip

\textbf{What you will be asked to do:} \medskip


This study is a controlled lab study, performed in a single session that will take no longer than 2 hours to complete. The study is composed of three parts, an introduction session, a period in which you are asked to work in a set of tasks, and a follow-up interview.  \medskip

If you agree to participate in this study, we will provide you with a computer and you will be asked to attempt 6 information seeking tasks. The tasks are designed to simulate software development tasks that are likely to incur information seeking activities that software development professionals encounter on a normal day of work, e.g. use an open source system reference documentation to locate configuration procedures to fetch data from the systemâ€™s database.  \medskip

For each task, you will read in any order that you wish their related documents and highlight any information that you judge relevant to the task-at-hand. Prior to proceeding to the next task, we will ask you to re-access your highlights and remove or include new ones if you wish to do so. After completing each task, you will complete a questionnaire assessing whether you found the correct information and rate the difficulty and your level of expertise in each task.  \medskip

You will proceed to the next task when you declare that you have finished your current task. At which point you will complete its questionnaire. We will signal the end of the task session at the 90 minutes mark such that there is sufficient time for the following procedures. Please note that time or completing all the tasks are not determining factors, and we encourage you to work at your normal pace.  \medskip

In a final step, you will participate in an interview in which we will ask you about the tasks that you worked on and the items that you highlighted. The interview will be audio-recorded and the interviewer will take written notes. \medskip
