{\large \textbf{Task: Lucene}} \bigskip

As a newcomer onboarding the Lucene project, an Open Source information retrieval system,
you are reviewing how it computes similarity scores during indexing. As a starting point, you
decided to read about one of its similarity functions, i.e. BM25. You filtered a set of documents
in the system's reference API as well as bug reports to help you in understanding how Lucene
computes scores during indexing.

How does Lucene compute similarity scores for the BM25 similarity?
