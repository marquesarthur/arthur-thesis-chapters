Part of this work involved other collaborators. Nick C. Bradley contributed in
the interview analysis described in Chapter~\ref{ch:characterizing}.
Alison Li, Katharine Kerr, and Tarc{\'i}sio Teixeira helped 
in the creation of the dataset presented in Chapter~\ref{ch:android-corpus}.
Giovanni Viviani helped in the analysis, design and implementation of the 
semantic parser used in Chapter~\ref{ch:identifying}.
Shaunak Tulshibagwale helped implementing some of the 
data gathering scripts for the 
corpora presented in Chapters~\ref{ch:identifying} and~\ref{ch:assisting}, respectively.
The scripts that gathered data from Stack Overflow are an extension of 
 Nadi and Treude's scripts~\cite{nadi2019Rep}.
Muhammad Abdul-Mageed was a supervisory committee member and helped providing access to the 
Compute Canada research grid used in the design and evaluation of the
approaches described in  Chapter~\ref{ch:identifying}.
Gail C. Murphy was the supervisory author on this project
and was involved throughout the project in concept formation, data analysis, and
manuscript composition.




All projects and associated methods were approved by the University of British Columbia's Research
