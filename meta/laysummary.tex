\chapter*{Lay Summary}

A software developer usually relies on web pages to find information that helps them complete a software task. 
However, only portions of the text in these web pages might be helpful to the developer's current task.
Finding the relevant parts can be difficult and require much time. The approaches that help developers perform this activity are limited to certain types of web pages, such as community forums, tutorials, and others. 
This thesis explores how we can find information relevant to a developer's tasks in a more general manner. 
First, we study text that developers find relevant to a task. 
Then we propose techniques that automatically find such text. 
We report how a tool built using one of these techniques helps developers perform a task. 
Results show that developers find that the text automatically identified by the tool has helpful information that assists them in completing a software task.
