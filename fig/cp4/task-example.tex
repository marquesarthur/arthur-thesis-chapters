\begin{frameEnv}{{\small Canvas is drawing too slowly}}
\begin{small}
    I have one ImageView that is showing one bitmap at a time. The problem I am having is that drawing the image to the ImageView is taking roughly 30ms. Since the frames need to be playing back at their original framerate, this is a problem. There are other operations going on as well that are also slowing the process down, but the drawing certainly isn't helping.

\begin{frameEnv}{{Timers can be wiped out when using GestureDetector}}
\begin{small}
    Due to the introduction of checkStatics, if any Timer is created within libGDX, it runs the risk of wiping out user-created timers. Specifically, if one is created after a pause event, and before a resume event, the Timer constructor will call checkStatics and will clear existing Timer instances.
