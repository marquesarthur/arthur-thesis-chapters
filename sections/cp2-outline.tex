\chapter{Related Work}
\label{ch:related-work}



Information foraging~\cite{Pirolli1999}, or the process through which an individual 
obtains knowledge that assists them accomplish a task often experiences paradigm shifts. 
At times, 
an information need was directed to a library clerk 
who would direct an individual towards 
sections of the library with books pertinent to the question 
posed by a person~\cite{saracevic1975}.
Then, when the \acf{web}~\cite{berners1994web} became popular,
individuals started to rely on search engines 
to seek information~\cite{Page1999} now digitally stored in the form of web pages.
Searching for pertinent artifacts, be them books or web pages, 
is one of the first steps to address an information need,
which we detail in Section~\ref{cp2:searching}.


Then, in possession of a pertinent artifact, careful 
inspection of its content might lead a person 
to find the information that they sought. 
However, due to some of the challenges
associated with finding pertinent information within 
an artifact discussed in the previous chapter, researchers from several 
disciplines have considered means to help 
in this activity. 
In Section~\ref{cp2:general-approaches}, 
we detail approaches from related work
that have investigated how to automatically identify relevant text. 
Then, in Section~\ref{cp2:task-approaches}, 
we hone in approaches 
for automating the identification of text 
likely relevant to a software task.




% Most of the techniques that extract information from natural language software artifacts
% are examples of applications that help developers in performing 
% software development activities~\cite{Meyer2017}. 
Given how 
natural language artifacts have become intrinsically
tied to software development~\cite{umarji2008archetypal},
we conclude this chapter with an overview of 
other applications that make use of textual data
to help developers
across many of the tasks in their daily work (Section~\ref{cp2:dev-productivity}).

% In the last chapter, we introduced some of the challenges
% associated with finding
% information relevant to a developer's task.
% In this chapter, we provide background information on 
% a number of empirical studies that give insight into
% the data available in natural language software artifacts 
% and we also present 
% automated tools that extract text from these artifacts.
% In Section~\ref{cp2:text-in-se}, we begin by providing an  
% overview of the types of textual analysis in the literature
% then, in Sections~\ref{cp2:general-approaches}
% and~\ref{cp2:task-approaches}, we
% detail general textual approaches 
% and task-specific approaches
% that identify and extract text from natural language software artifacts, respectively.
% First, we provide an overview on the kinds of approaches 
% used to extract data from natural language software artifacts.
% Then, we detail how these approaches 
% have been used for automating the identification of text 
% likely relevant to a software task~\cite{a}.
