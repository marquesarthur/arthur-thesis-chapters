In the last chapter, we introduced some of the challenges
associated with finding
information relevant to a developer's task 
% i.e., finding the text useful for a particular task in natural language artifacts can be a time-consuming
% and cognitively frustrating process~\cite{Begel2008,
% robillard2011field}.
and, to help 
software engineering researchers make more informed decisions 
on the design of tools 
that assist developers 
in this activity,
 a number of empirical studies give insight 
 into the properties of the text in different kinds of software artifacts~\cite{a}.
 In Section~\ref{cp2:text-in-se}, we provide an 
overview of the types of textual analysis in the literature.





Recognizing that text in natural language
artifacts assist developers in several software development activities,
researchers have 
proposed various approaches and tools 
to extract information from this text. 
A set of approaches automate the extraction of text 
for certain kinds of natural language artifacts, e.g., bug reports, and 
specific activities, e.g., bug triaging~\cite{a}. 
Other approaches consider a developer's task 
and automate the identification of text of interest 
to that particular software task~\cite{a}.
In Sections~\ref{cp2:general-approaches}
and~\ref{cp2:task-approaches}, we
detail general textual approaches 
and task-specific approaches
that identify and extract text from natural language software artifacts, respectively.





Most of the techniques that extract information from natural language software artifacts, including the work presented in this thesis, 
are examples of applications that help developers in performing 
software development activities~\cite{Meyer2017}. 
Given how 
natural language artifacts have become intrinsically
tied to software development~\cite{liu2021, watson2022, umarji2008archetypal},
in Section~\ref{cp2:dev-productivity}, 
we discuss
other applications that make use of textual data
to help developers
across many of the tasks in their daily work~\cite{Treude2016,  robillard2017, silva2019}.
