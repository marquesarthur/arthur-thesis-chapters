\chapter{Related Work}
\label{ch:related-work}








Performing a task on a software system, like fixing a bug
or adding a feature typically requires a developer to consult
a number of different kinds of artifacts, such
as API documentation, bug reports, community forums
and web tutorials~\cite{umarji2008archetypal,Li2013}. 
In this chapter, 
we expand our scenario on how developers consult 
natural language artifacts
 for information that might assist them in completing a task 
and on the challenges that developers face (Section~\ref{cp1:example})
by providing a more in depth discussion 
about the significant body of work 
in the field. 
First, we provide 
a categorization of studies that investigate 
several aspects about natural language software artifacts 
and how software developers make use of them (Section~\ref{cp2:text-in-se})
and then, we outline automatic techniques that
assist developers in finding information within these artifacts by 
identifying text of interest 
to a particular task (Section~\ref{cp2:automatic-approaches}).



% Since finding information relevant to a task is 
% a time-consuming and cognitively frustrating process~\cite{Begel2008,
%  robillard2011field}, many researchers in the 
% software engineering field have studied
% how to extract information from such natural language 
% artifacts to assist developers performing a task~\cite{Holmes2008, Cubranic2005, Bavota2016}.

% and there has been a steep growth in the number

% properties of the text

% and design approaches that 
% can be embedded in

Given how 
natural language artifacts have become intrinsically
tied to software development~\cite{liu2021, watson2022, umarji2008archetypal},
most of the techniques that extract information from these artifacts, including the work presented in this thesis, 
are examples of applications that help developers in performing 
software development activities~\cite{Meyer2017}. 
Other applications have exploited textual data
to provide guidance to developers reading software documents~\cite{Treude2016,  robillard2017} 
or  to  explain solutions for programming tasks found in development community forums~\cite{silva2019}.
We discuss these and other applications in Section~\ref{cp2:dev-productivity}.
