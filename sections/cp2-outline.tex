The process through which an individual 
obtains knowledge often experiences paradigm shifts~\cite{Pirolli1999}. 
At times, 
an information need would be directed to a library clerk who would suggest books for the person's search~\cite{saracevic1975}.
Then, when the \acf{web}~\cite{berners1994web} became popular,
individuals started to rely on search engines 
to seek information now digitally stored in web pages~\cite{Page1999}.
Searching for pertinent artifacts, be them books or web pages, 
is one of the first steps to address an information need,
which we detail in Section~\ref{cp2:searching}.




In possession of a potentially relevant artifact, careful 
inspection of its content might lead a person 
to find the information that they sought and
researchers from several 
disciplines have considered means to help 
in this activity. 
In Section~\ref{cp2:general-approaches}, 
we detail general approaches that mine information
from natural language text. 
Then, in Section~\ref{cp2:task-approaches}, 
we hone in on approaches that
automatically identify text 
containing information likely relevant to an input software task.




% Most of the techniques that extract information from natural language software artifacts
% are examples of applications that help developers in performing 
% software development activities~\cite{Meyer2017}. 
Given how 
natural language artifacts have become intrinsically
tied to software development~\cite{umarji2008archetypal},
we conclude this chapter with an overview of 
other applications that make use of textual data
to help developers
across many of the tasks in their daily work (Section~\ref{cp2:dev-productivity}).



% In the last chapter, we introduced some of the challenges
% associated with finding
% information relevant to a developer's task.
% In this chapter, we provide background information on 
% a number of empirical studies that give insight into
% the data available in natural language software artifacts 
% and we also present 
% automated tools that extract text from these artifacts.
% In Section~\ref{cp2:text-in-se}, we begin by providing an  
% overview of the types of textual analysis in the literature
% then, in Sections~\ref{cp2:general-approaches}
% and~\ref{cp2:task-approaches}, we
% detail general textual approaches 
% and task-specific approaches
% that identify and extract text from natural language software artifacts, respectively.
% First, we provide an overview on the kinds of approaches 
% used to extract data from natural language software artifacts.
% Then, we detail how these approaches 
% have been used for automating the identification of text 
% likely relevant to a software task~\cite{a}.
