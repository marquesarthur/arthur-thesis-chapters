Performing a task on a software system, like fixing a bug
or adding a feature typically requires a developer to consult
a number of different kinds of artifacts, such
as API documentation, bug reports, community forums
and web tutorials. 
We have provided an overview on how these software
artifacts contain structured and unstructured parts, 
with both code elements and natural language text
as well as challenges associated with finding task-relevant information 
in these artifacts (Section~\ref{cp1:example})
and many researchers in the 
software engineering field have studied
how to extract information from such natural language 
artifacts to assist developers performing a task~\cite{Holmes2008, Cubranic2005, Bavota2016}. 
In Section~\ref{cp2:text-in-se}, we provide 
a categorization of studies that investigate 
several aspects about these artifacts 
and how software developers make use of them.
In Section~\ref{cp2:automatic-approaches},
we outline techniques that
assist developers in finding information in 
certain natural language artifacts by 
automatically identifying text of interest 
to a particular task.

Given how 
natural language artifacts have become intrinsically
tied to software development~\cite{liu2021, watson2022, umarji2008archetypal},
most of the techniques that extract information from these artifacts, including the work presented in this thesis, 
are examples of applications that help developers in performing 
software development activities~\cite{Meyer2017}. 
Other applications have exploited textual data
to provide guidance to developers reading software documents~\cite{Treude2016,  robillard2017} 
or  to  explain solutions for programming tasks found in development community forums~\cite{silva2019}.
We discuss these and other applications in Section~\ref{cp2:dev-productivity}.
