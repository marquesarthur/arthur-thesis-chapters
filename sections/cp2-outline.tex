\chapter{Related Work}
\label{ch:related-work}








Performing a task on a software system, like fixing a bug
or adding a feature typically requires a developer to consult
a number of different kinds of artifacts, such
as API documentation, bug reports, community forums
and web tutorials. 
Developers produce such natural language artifacts on a 
continuous basis~\cite{Rastkar2013t} 
and in Section~\ref{cp2:text-properties} we  provide background information 
on the many studies that investigate 
properties of the natural language text 
appearing in these software artifacts.





Properties or aspects of the natural language 
text 
have been used 
by software engineering researchers
to extract
information that can be embedded in
tools that assist software developers perform several activities.
In Section~\ref{cp2:text-approaches}, we review 
prior work that uses
syntactic properties of the text, and an artifact's meta-data, 
to automatically identify relevant text for particular kinds of artifacts.
In Section~\ref{cp2:text-semantics},
we provide background information on semantic approaches,
honing in on studies that apply these approaches to 
software engineering artifacts.



Most of the techniques that extract information from natural 
language artifacts, including the work presented in this thesis, are examples of applications that improve developers' productivity. 
We discuss examples of other applications 
and research that seek to facilitate or improve how developers 
work in Section~\ref{cp2:dev-productivity}.



% More recently, researchers have also started to use semantic approaches; 
% in Section~\ref{cp2:artifact-semantics} we 
% provide an overview of these approaches to provide a background of
% how semantics can be useful to support software development activities.
