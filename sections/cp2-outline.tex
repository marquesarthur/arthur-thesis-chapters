Performing a task on a software system typically requires a developer to consult
a number of different kinds of artifacts~\cite{umarji2008archetypal,Li2013}
and, given the challenges associated with finding
information relevant to a developer's task
within these artifacts~\cite{Starke2009,DeGraaf2014},
in Section~\ref{cp2:text-in-se}, we provide a background information on empirical studies that 
have 
investigated 
natural language text in software artifacts
and how software developers make use of these artifacts.







Researchers have long recognized the value of the text in natural language
artifacts, utilizing various approaches and tools 
to extract information from this text. 
In Section~\ref{cp2:automatic-approaches}, 
we present a categorization of 
 automatic approaches that
extract information from natural language artifacts
then, Section~\ref{cp2:automatic-approaches}, 
we
hone in on the approaches that
assist developers in finding text of interest 
to a particular software task.






Most of the techniques that extract information from natural language software artifacts, including the work presented in this thesis, 
are examples of applications that help developers in performing 
software development activities~\cite{Meyer2017}. 
Given how 
natural language artifacts have become intrinsically
tied to software development~\cite{liu2021, watson2022, umarji2008archetypal},
in Section~\ref{cp2:dev-productivity}, 
we discuss
other applications that make use of textual data
to help developers
across many of the tasks in their daily work~\cite{Treude2016,  robillard2017, silva2019}.
