\art{shorten 1st paragraph}


Performing a task on a software system, like fixing a bug
or adding a feature typically requires a developer to consult
a number of different kinds of artifacts, such
as API documentation, bug reports, community forums
and web tutorials~\cite{umarji2008archetypal,Li2013}
and, given the challenges associated with finding
information relevant to a developer's task
within these and other natural language artifacts~\cite{Starke2009,DeGraaf2014},
we provide a categorization of studies that 
have 
investigated 
several aspects associated with natural language software artifacts
and how software developers make use of them in Section~\ref{cp2:text-in-se}.







Researchers have long recognized the value of the text in natural language
artifacts, utilizing various techniques and tools 
to extract information from this text. 
In Section~\ref{cp2:automatic-approaches}, 
we present automatic techniques that
assist developers in finding information within these natural language artifacts
honing in on techniques that identify text of interest 
to a particular software task.






Most of the techniques that extract information from natural language software artifacts, including the work presented in this thesis, 
are examples of applications that help developers in performing 
software development activities~\cite{Meyer2017}. 
Given how 
natural language artifacts have become intrinsically
tied to software development~\cite{liu2021, watson2022, umarji2008archetypal},
in Section~\ref{cp2:dev-productivity}, 
we discuss
other applications that make use of textual data
to help developers
across many of the tasks in their daily work~\cite{Treude2016,  robillard2017, silva2019}.
