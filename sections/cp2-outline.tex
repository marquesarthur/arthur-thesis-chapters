\chapter{Related Work}
\label{ch:related-work}




In the last chapter, we introduced some of the challenges
associated with finding
information relevant to a developer's task.
In this chapter, we provide background information on 
a number of empirical studies that give insight into
the data available in natural language software artifacts 
and we also present 
automated tools that extract text from these artifacts.
In Section~\ref{cp2:text-in-se}, we begin by providing an  
overview of the types of textual analysis in the literature
then, in Sections~\ref{cp2:general-approaches}
and~\ref{cp2:task-approaches}, we
detail general textual approaches 
and task-specific approaches
that identify and extract text from natural language software artifacts, respectively.
First, we provide an overview on the kinds of approaches 
used to extract data from natural language software artifacts.
Then, we detail how these approaches 
have been used for automating the identification of text 
likely relevant to a software task~\cite{a}.






Most of the techniques that extract information from natural language software artifacts, including the work presented in this thesis, 
are examples of applications that help developers in performing 
software development activities~\cite{Meyer2017}. 
Given how 
natural language artifacts have become intrinsically
tied to software development~\cite{umarji2008archetypal},
we discuss
other applications that make use of textual data
to help developers
across many of the tasks in their daily work in Section~\ref{cp2:dev-productivity}.
