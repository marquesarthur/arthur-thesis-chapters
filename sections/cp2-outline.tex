The process through which an individual 
obtains knowledge often experiences paradigm shifts~\cite{Pirolli1999}. 
At times, 
an information need would be directed to a librarian who would suggest books for the person's search~\cite{saracevic1975}.
Then, when the \acf{web}~\cite{berners1994web} became popular,
individuals started to rely on search engines 
to seek information now digitally stored in web pages~\cite{Page1999}.
Searching for pertinent artifacts, be them books or web pages, 
is one of the first steps to address an information need,
which we detail in Section~\ref{cp2:searching}.




In possession of a potentially relevant artifact, careful 
inspection of its content might lead a person 
to find the information that they sought and
researchers from several 
disciplines have considered means to help 
in this activity. 
In Section~\ref{cp2:general-approaches}, 
we detail general approaches that mine information
from natural language text. 
Then, in Section~\ref{cp2:task-approaches}, 
we hone in on approaches that
automatically identify text 
containing information likely relevant to an input software task.




% Most of the techniques that extract information from natural language software artifacts
% are examples of applications that help developers in performing 
% software development activities~\cite{Meyer2017}. 
Given how 
natural language artifacts have become intrinsically
tied to software development~\cite{umarji2008archetypal},
we conclude this chapter with an overview of 
other applications that make use of textual data
to help developers
across many of the tasks in their daily work (Section~\ref{cp2:dev-productivity}).
