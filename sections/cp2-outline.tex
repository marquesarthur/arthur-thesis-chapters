\chapter{Related Work}
\label{ch:related-work}








Performing a task on a software system, like fixing a bug
or adding a feature typically requires a developer to consult
a number of different kinds of artifacts, such
as API documentation, bug reports, community forums
and web tutorials. 
Developers produce such natural language artifacts on a 
continuous basis~\cite{Rastkar2013t} 
and there has been a steep growth in the number 
of natural language artifacts available~\cite{Bavota2016, aa}.


Natural language artifacts have become intrinsically tied to software development~\cite{liu2021},
what led 
 software engineering researchers to both
investigate 
properties of the text 
appearing in these artifacts~\cite{aa}
and design approaches that 
can be embedded in
tools that mine the textual data available to assist software developer performing some task~\cite{aa}.
In Sections~\ref{cp2:text-in-se} and~\ref{cp2:automatic-approaches}
we respectively provide background information on the significant body 
of work that investigates properties of the text in software engineering 
artifacts and the techniques that automatically identify text of interest 
to a particular task.







Most of the techniques that extract information from natural 
language artifacts, including the work presented in this thesis, 
are examples of applications that assist help developers in performing 
several tasks during their work day~\cite{Meyer2017}. 
Other applications have exploited textual data
to provide guidance to developers reading software documents~\cite{Treude2016,  robillard2017} 
or  to  explain solutions for programming tasks found in community forums~\cite{silva2019}.
We discuss these and other applications in Section~\ref{cp2:dev-productivity}.
