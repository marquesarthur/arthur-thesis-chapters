Information foraging~\cite{Pirolli1999}, or the process through which an individual 
obtains knowledge that assists them accomplish a task often experiences paradigm shifts. 
At times, 
an information need would be directed to a library clerk who would suggest books for the person's search~\cite{saracevic1975}.
Then, when the \acf{web}~\cite{berners1994web} became popular,
individuals started to rely on search engines 
to seek information~\cite{Page1999} now digitally stored in web pages.
Searching for pertinent artifacts, be them books or web pages, 
is one of the first steps to address an information need,
which we detail in Section~\ref{cp2:searching}.


In possession of a pertinent artifact, careful 
inspection of its content might lead a person 
to find the information that they sought. 
However, due to some of the challenges
discussed in the previous chapter, researchers from several 
disciplines have considered means to help 
in this activity. 
In Section~\ref{cp2:general-approaches}, 
we detail general approaches that mine information
from natural language text. 
Then, in Section~\ref{cp2:task-approaches}, 
we hone in on approaches that
automatically identify text 
containing information likely relevant to an input software task.




% Most of the techniques that extract information from natural language software artifacts
% are examples of applications that help developers in performing 
% software development activities~\cite{Meyer2017}. 
Given how 
natural language artifacts have become intrinsically
tied to software development~\cite{umarji2008archetypal},
we conclude this chapter with an overview of 
other applications that make use of textual data
to help developers
across many of the tasks in their daily work (Section~\ref{cp2:dev-productivity}).



% In the last chapter, we introduced some of the challenges
% associated with finding
% information relevant to a developer's task.
% In this chapter, we provide background information on 
% a number of empirical studies that give insight into
% the data available in natural language software artifacts 
% and we also present 
% automated tools that extract text from these artifacts.
% In Section~\ref{cp2:text-in-se}, we begin by providing an  
% overview of the types of textual analysis in the literature
% then, in Sections~\ref{cp2:general-approaches}
% and~\ref{cp2:task-approaches}, we
% detail general textual approaches 
% and task-specific approaches
% that identify and extract text from natural language software artifacts, respectively.
% First, we provide an overview on the kinds of approaches 
% used to extract data from natural language software artifacts.
% Then, we detail how these approaches 
% have been used for automating the identification of text 
% likely relevant to a software task~\cite{a}.
