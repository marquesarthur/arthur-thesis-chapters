\chapter{Related Work}
\label{ch:related-work}








Performing a task on a software system, like fixing a bug
or adding a feature typically requires a developer to consult
a number of different kinds of artifacts, such
as API documentation, bug reports, community forums
and web tutorials. 
Developers produce such natural language artifacts on a 
continuous basis~\cite{Rastkar2013t} 
and there has been a steep growth in the number 
of natural language artifacts available~\cite{Bavota2016, aa}.


The prevalence of online web resources and how their usage has become intrinsically tied to software development~\cite{} has led 
 software engineering researchers to 
investigate 
properties of the text 
appearing in natural language software artifacts~\cite{aa}
and also to design approaches that 
can be embedded in
tools that mine the textual data available in these artifacts~\cite{aa}.
In Sections~\ref{cp2:text-in-se} and~\ref{cp2:text-approaches}
we  provide background information on the significant body 
of work that investigates properties of the text in software engineering 
artifacts and the techniques that automatically identify text of interest 
to a particular task, respectively.







Most of the techniques that extract information from natural 
language artifacts, including the work presented in this thesis, 
are examples of applications that assist developers in performing 
software tasks. 
Other applications have exploited textual data
to produce better software documentation~\cite{Treude2016, mcburney2014, robillard2017} 
or  succinct  explanations of solutions for programming tasks~\cite{silva2019}.
We discuss these and other applications in Section~\ref{cp2:dev-productivity}.
