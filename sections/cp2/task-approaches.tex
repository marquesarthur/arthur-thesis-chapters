As part of their work, developers engage in many sensemaking and decision making activities~\cite{sillito2006} and several studies have investigated how to 
provide means to better  
assist developers in performing such activities~\cite{Liu2018Unakite, liu2021, barnett2015}.
For example, tools such as Deep Intellisense 
display code changes, filed bugs, and forum discussions 
mined from an organization's database to better assist a developer
understand 
the rationale behind the code they currently work on~\cite{Holmes2008},
and researchers have extended this idea to  
publicly available data, e.g., GitHub issues~\cite{Viviani2019}
or pull requests~\cite{freire2021}. 



Researchers have also had a long interest in 
making knowledge bases
that developers working on a task can benefit from. 
Hipikat~\cite{Cubranic2005} is a seminal tool that exemplifies this concept in action.
Based on the current code being inspected by a developer, 
it recommends artifacts from a project's archive 
that are pertinent to the code being inspected~\cite{Cubranic2005}.
Other tools like Strata summarize knowledge produced by developers 
while they navigate on the web so that other developers have a 
 head start when performing similar tasks~\cite{liu2021}.
