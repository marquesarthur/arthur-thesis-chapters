% \subsection{Machine Learning Approaches} 


% To bridge lexical gaps, researchers have investigated 
% approaches that leverage the 
% semantic aspects of software artifacts~\cite{Maletic2001, Ye2016}.
% While Section~\ref{cp2:artifact-semantics} provides an overview of semantics 
% in software engineering, this section especifically details how semantics might assist in finding 
% pertinent artifacts.

% While ML approaches are effective in locating pertinent artifacts, a developer still needs to
% manually find the parts within that artifact
% that are relevant to her task~\cite{Cubranic2005}.
