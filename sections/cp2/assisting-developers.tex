\label{cp2:dev-productivity}



The tools and approaches presented in Sections~\ref{cp2:general-approaches}
and~\ref{cp2:task-approaches}
are examples of studies that help developers in locating 
information that assists them in completing a software task.
These studies fit in the bigger context 
of software engineering research 
facilitating or improving the quality of a developer's work~\cite{Kersten2006, Meyer2017, satterfield2020}. 





As part of their work, developers engage in many sensemaking and decision-making activities~\cite{sillito2006} and several studies have investigated how to 
provide means to better  
assist developers in performing such activities~\cite{Liu2018Unakite, liu2021, barnett2015}.
For example, 
Ponzanelli et al. proposed a tool, Libra, that monitors the web pages a developer 
has navigated and uses that to show 
how similar or not the results of a new web search are in comparison to the already navigated 
pages, which offers contextual information-seeking support~\cite{Ponzanelli2017}.



Researchers have also been interested in 
making knowledge bases
that developers working on a task can benefit from. 
In Section~\ref{cp2:task-approaches} 
we cited Hipikat~\cite{Cubranic2005}, a seminal tool that exemplifies this concept in action.
Based on the current code being inspected by a developer or based on a query prompted by a developer, 
it recommends artifacts from a project's archive 
that are pertinent to the code being inspected.
This archive, or project memory, is produced 
based either on relationships between the artifacts in a software project 
or based on the source code changed in a bug fix or feature request~\cite{Cubranic2005}.
Other tools like Strata summarize knowledge produced by developers 
while they navigate on the web so that other developers
can use this knowledge to have a 
 head start when performing similar tasks~\cite{liu2021}.




We build upon many of the research procedures outlined 
in these and many other studies in the field. 
For example, in the evaluation of Strata, 
 Liu et al. describe procedures 
considering how a control and tool-assisted group 
complete information-seeking tasks~\cite{liu2021},
which assisted in the design of our experiment for 
evaluating an automated approach to
task-relevant text identification (Chapter~\ref{ch:assisting}).
