\subsection{Characterizing Task-relevant Text}




Many studies have provided possible properties that guide identifying text relevant to a developer's task~\cite{Bavota2016}.
Some of these studies 
detail qualitative aspects that individuals use to assess relevance~\cite{Barry1994, Freund2015, Forward2002}.
Other studies provide quantitative data in the form of 
text annotated as relevant for certain software tasks~\cite{Jiang2016b, Robillard2015}. 
Although these studies shed light upon many aspects regarding relevance,
there is little to no evidence that the cues used to determine relevant text in the tasks and artifacts 
of a particular study also apply to different tasks and artifacts. 
Existing quantitative data also does not focus on whether different developers 
use the same properties to determine text relevant to their tasks~\cite{Freund2013, Freund2015}.



Therefore, we identify the need to empirically study whether
there is consistency in the text within natural language artifacts
that software developers identify as relevant to a task and, if there
is consistency, what are common characteristics in the textual fragments identified as task-relevant?
Determining common cues that
developers use regardless of an artifact's type
is thus an essential step towards the design of techniques that automatically determine
the relevance of text to tasks.

% or may not reach consensus~\cite{Saracevic2007c}.
% By investigating how several software developers assess textual cues in the content of a patch to determine its relevance (Section~\ref{sec:rq-initial-study}),
% we aim to add to the existing theory of assessing relevance within a patch.
