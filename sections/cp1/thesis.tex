\label{cp1:thesis}



My thesis is that we might relax the limitations of existing
artifact-specific approaches when  
interpreting the meaning, or \textit{semantics}, of text 
for a variety of natural language software artifacts pertinent to a particular task.
I posit that:



\medskip
\begin{bluequote}
    \textit{
        A developer can more effectively complete a software development task when provided
        with text that automatic techniques determine as relevant to the developer's task
        according to the meaning, or semantics, of the text.
    }
\end{bluequote}



\smallskip
To validate this thesis statement, I start by investigating whether there is consistency in
 the meaning of the text within various natural language artifacts that software developers
  identify as relevant to a task.
Understanding what text developers deem relevant to a certain task, we can determine
 common semantic cues that these developers used to locate task-relevant text regardless of an artifact's type. 
As a result, we can design automatic techniques that use such semantic cues to identify
 text relevant to a developer's task.
Thereupon, evaluating the impact of tools that use such techniques in the developer's work.
