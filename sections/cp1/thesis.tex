My thesis is that:

\begin{bluequote}
    \textit{
        A developer can more effectively complete a software development task when provided
        with text that automatic techniques determine as relevant to the developer's task
        according to the meaning, or semantics, of the text.
    }
\end{bluequote}



\smallskip
Semantic approaches have been successfully used for a variety of development activities, such as
for finding who should fix a bug~\cite{yang2016}, searching for comprehensive code examples~\cite{silva2019},
or assessing the quality of information available in bug reports~\cite{chaparro2019}. 
Hence, I posit that semantics applies for identifying text containing information
relevant to a developer task in a more general manner. 





To validate this thesis statement, I start by investigating whether there is consistency in the meaning of the text within various natural language artifacts that software developers identify as relevant to a task.
This investigation provides the basis for determining common semantic cues that developers use to locate task-relevant text regardless of an artifact's type. 
As a result, we can design automatic techniques that use such semantic cues to identify text relevant to a developer's task.
Thereupon, evaluating the impact of tools that use such techniques to assist developers in completing software tasks.




% My thesis is that interpreting the meaning, or \textit{semantics}, 
% of text poses a more generalizable approach for identifying information
% relevant to a developer's task in a variety of natural language
% software artifacts pertinent to that task.
