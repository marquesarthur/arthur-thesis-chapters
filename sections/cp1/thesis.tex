\label{cp1:thesis}





The scenario we presented in Section~\ref{cp1:example}
 indicates that many kinds of 
artifacts can be consulted to help 
with a task and that a developer faces challenges in finding the text within these 
artifacts is relevant to the task at hand. 
In surveying the state of the art, we demonstrated that existing techniques are tied to particular
artifacts. This thesis aims to overcome these limitations. We posit that:

    \textit{A developer can effectively complete a software development task when automatically provided with text relevant to their task extracted from pertinent natural language artifacts
    by a generalizable technique.}
\end{bluequote}
\medskip



One potential method for designing a generalizable technique 
might arise from 
determining if there are similar rules governing how text relevant to a task is 
constructed across different types of artifacts~\cite{Kintsch1978a}.
Hence, we ask what are common properties, if any, in the text deemed relevant 
to a software task and found across different types of artifacts?
To answer this question, we present a formative study that 
examines the text that twenty developers deemed relevant in artifacts 
of different types associated with six software tasks.


By \textit{characterizing} task-relevant text found in different kinds of artifacts,
this study complements and adds to previous research that has
examined text relevant to particular tasks and one kind of artifact~\cite{Ko2006, Rastkar2010, Chaparro2017, Robillard2015}.
Notably, our analysis of natural language text  in bug
reports, API documents and \ac{qa} websites 
inspected as part of this study 
 show consistency in the meaning, or \textit{semantics}, of the
 text deemed relevant to a task by a developer, suggesting that 
semantics might assist in the automatic identification of
task-relevant text and in the design of a more generalizable technique.




Approaches that interpret the meaning of the text have been successfully used for a variety of development activities,
such as for finding who should fix a bug~\cite{yang2016}, searching for comprehensive code examples~\cite{silva2019}, or assessing the quality of information available in bug reports~\cite{chaparro2019}.
Nonetheless, we are not aware of their usage in techniques 
that assists developers in discovering task-relevant text over different types of natural language artifacts.
To this end, this thesis describes the investigation of a design space
of six possible techniques that incorporate the semantics of words~\cite{Mikolov2013, Devlin2018Bert}
and sentences~\cite{fillmore1976frame, marques2021}
to automatically identify text likely relevant to a developer's task.
Assessment of these techniques reveals that semantic-based techniques
achieve recall comparable to a state-of-the-art technique aimed at one type of artifact~\cite{Xu2017}, but 
that they do so across
multiple artifact types.






With our formative study, we find consistency in the text  that is relevant to a task within different kinds of artifacts.
With our empirical assessment, we also find that that semantic-based techniques can automatically identify such text.
However, these studies do not address whether a semantic-based approach can \textit{assist} a software developer while they work on a task.
Hence, we introduce \acs{tool}\footnote{
    Automatic \underline{Ta}sk-\underline{R}elevant \underline{T}ext \underline{I}dentifier
}, a web browser plug-in that 
automatically identifies and highlights text relevant to a developer's task.
We evaluate \acs{tool} with a controlled experiment that investigates the presence (or absence) of benefits that are brought by using \acs{tool}.
We report how  participants 
performed two Python programming tasks when 
 assisted (or not) by \acs{tool},
where experimental results indicate that participants found the text automatically identified
by the tool 
useful in two out of the three tasks of the experiment.
Furthermore, tool support also led to more correct solutions 
in one of the tasks in the experiment, providing thus
initial evidence on the role of semantic-based tools 
for supporting a developer's discovery of task-relevant information
across different natural language artifacts.
