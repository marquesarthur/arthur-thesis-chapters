\label{cp1:contributions}


The work presented in this thesis 
aims to improve how developers locate task-relevant information and thus, assist them in making more informed decisions related to their task.
Contributions that arise from this work are divided in three main categories, namely 
empirical studies, techniques, and corpora.



% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{\textbf{Empirical Studies.}} 

It reports on two empirical studies for supporting a developer's discovery of task-relevant information:

\begin{itemize}

    \item A first study characterizes how task-relevant text appears across a variety of natural language artifacts pertinent to a set of software tasks; this study demonstrates consistency in the text 
    considered key to completing six information seeking tasks, and identifies 
    promising semantic-based approaches that can be used to identify task-relevant information in natural language artifacts; 

    \item A second study addresses whether 
    the text automatically identified by semantic-based techniques can assist a software developer while they work on a task; this study provides initial evidence that such tools affect how developers complete a task 
    based on the text that it automatically identifies.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\textbf{Techniques.}} 

It introduces six possible techniques that incorporate the semantics of words and sentences for identifying task-relevant text in software artifacts, where:
    
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item it reports on the precision and recall of semantic-based techniques for the identification of text that human annotators deemed relevant to tasks associated with Android development; and
    \item it shows that semantic approaches have recall comparable to state-of-the-art approaches
    tailored specifically to certain kinds of artifacts.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\textbf{Datasets.}} 

It presents three different datasets that can be used for replication purposes and future research in the field, namely:
    
\begin{itemize}
    \item \acs{DS-synthetic} provides a unique corpus of 20 natural language artifacts associated
    with open-source projects that includes annotations from 20 participants of text deemed as relevant to six information-seeking tasks;
    
    \item \acs{DS-android} provides 50 Android tasks and associated textually-based artifacts
    that three annotators inspected indicating which text in the artifacts they deemed pertinent to these tasks;

    \item \acs{DS-python} contains three tasks related to well-known Python libraries with artifacts
    that includes annotations from 24 participants that indicated what text assisted them in writing a solution for these coding tasks.
\end{itemize}
