This thesis makes the following contributions to the field of software engineering:

\paragraph{\textbf{Empirical Studies.}} 

It reports on two empirical studies for supporting a developer's discovery of task-relevant information:

\begin{itemize}

    \item A first study characterizes how task-relevant text appears across a variety of natural language artifacts, including  API documentation, Q\&A websites, and
    bug reports that are pertinent to six software tasks; 

    \item A second study addresses whether 
    an automated approach to task-relevant text identification assists a software developer while they work on a task; this study provides empirical evidence on the role of semantic-based tools that assist developers in locating 
    text relevant to a particular task.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\textbf{Techniques.}} 

It introduces six possible techniques that incorporate the semantics of words and sentences for identifying task-relevant text in software artifacts, where:
    
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item we report on the precision and recall of semantic-based techniques for the identification of text that human annotators deemed relevant to natural language artifacts and tasks associated with Android development; and

    \item we show that semantic approaches have recall comparable to a state-of-the-art approach
    tailored to one kind of artifact, i.e., Stack Overflow.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\textbf{Datasets.}} A second contribution that arises from this work of dissertation 
are three different datasets ({\small \textit{DS}}) that can be used for replication purposes and future research in the field, namely:
    
\begin{itemize}
    \item \acs{DS-synthetic} provides a unique corpus of 20 natural language artifacts associated
    with natural language artifacts that include annotations from 20 participants of text deemed relevant to six software tasks; this dataset was produced as part of our study on characterizing task-relevant text;
    
    \item \acs{DS-android} is a dataset with 50 Android tasks and associated text artifacts 
    that we produced to evaluate the semantic-based techniques that we explore;

    \item \acs{DS-python} is a by-product of our empirical evaluation on the impact of tools that automatically identify task-relevant text;
    it contains three Python tasks and it includes annotations from 24 participants that indicated what text assisted them in writing each task's solution.
\end{itemize}
