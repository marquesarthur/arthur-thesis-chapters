\section{Structure of the Thesis}
\label{cp1:organization}

In Chapter~\ref{ch:related-work}, we present an overview of state of the art. The chapter details 
how \red{developers forage information} and existing approaches and tools 
that assist in different phases of this process.


Chapter~\ref{ch:characterizing} presents our empirical study to characterize task-relevant text.
We provide details on the tasks and artifacts that we have selected for this study
and then, we present our findings on the text considered relevant 
and the qualitative factors related to locating task-relevant text.


Chapter~\ref{ch:android-corpus} describes the groundwork 
for producing the corpus (\acs{DS-android}) that we use to evaluate the semantic-based techniques 
detailed in the chapter that follows. It describes the selection of tasks 
% (Section~\ref{cp4:corpus-tasks}) 
and 
artifacts pertinent to each task 
% (Section~\ref{cp4:corpus-artifacts})
as well as how three human annotators identified relevant text in each of the artifacts gathered.
%  (Section~\ref{cp4:corpus-relevant-text}).


Chapter~\ref{ch:identifying} details the semantic-based techniques we investigate for automatically 
identifying task-relvant text.
The first two techniques that the chapter presents 
use word embeddings to identify likely relevant text via semantic similarity
and via a deep neural network.
A third sentence-level technique filters (or not) 
the output of the word-level techniques according to frame semantics analysis.
%  (Section~\ref{cp5:approaches}).
We combine these techniques for a total of six possible techniques, 
assessing 
the text that they automatically identify for the tasks and artifact types
available in the \acs{DS-android} corpus.
%   (Section~\ref{cp5:evaluation}).




Chapter~\ref{ch:assisting} details our empirical experiment investigating 
whether a tool embedding a semantic-based technique assists a software developer in locating information
that helps them complete Python programming tasks. We begin by detailing experimental procedures
%  (Section~\ref{cp6:experiment})
and then, we report results from the experiment.
%  (Section~\ref{cp6:results}).


Chapter~\ref{ch:discussion}  discusses challenges and decisions 
made throughout our work 
as well as implications from our findings. 


Chapter~\ref{ch:summary} concludes this work by reflecting on the contributions in the thesis
and by outlining  potential future work.
