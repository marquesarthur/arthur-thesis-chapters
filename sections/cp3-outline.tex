\chapter{Characterizing Task-relevant Text}
\label{ch:characterizing}



In the last chapter,
we described several studies that analyze text in software engineering artifacts
and many approaches that attempt to extract relevant information from
these natural language artifacts automatically. However, 
we have described that
most of these approaches focus on 
one or only a 
few types of artifacts
leaving open the question of 
how to identify text relevant to a task regardless of an artifact's type.


% To design
% generalizable technique as described in our thesis statement,
% we ask whether
% there is consistency in the text
% that software developers identify as relevant to a task across
% different kinds of artifacts, and if there is consistency, we also ask
% what are common relevance cues in the portions of
% the text identified as relevant?
% Determining common cues that
% developers use regardless of an artifact's type
% could provide valuable
% insights for the design of a generalizable 
% technique~\cite{Bavota2016}.




To address this questions, 
this chapter presents an
\textit{empirical study} in which we
investigate whether 
there are common cues in the text
that software developers identify as relevant to a task across
different kinds of artifacts.
To investigate such cues, we 
asked 20 participants with
software development experience to identify relevant text within
selected artifacts for six distinct software development tasks.
We analyze the text that participants considered relevant 
to gain insight into properties of the text 
that are indicative of its relevance to a task~\cite{das2014frame, jurafsky2014speech}
while also reporting the participants'
reasoning process for determining relevance,
 gathered through interviews
that we use as part of our analysis on
their information-foraging process.



We start by presenting the research questions that guide 
the design of our study (Section~\ref{cp3:method}).
We then detail experimental procedures (Section~\ref{cp3:experiment}) 
and results (Section~\ref{cp3:results}),
concluding the chapter with a summary of our findings (Section~\ref{cp3:summary}).
