\chapter{Android Task Corpus}
\label{ch:android-corpus}



% ART: move to an early chapter
% To produce a solution for a task, a developer engages in a variety of
% information-seeking activities.  One of these activities involves
% the identification of  text in artifacts \gm{relevant to helping solve the task}.


The development of techniques
to automate the identification of relevant text
to solving a task in artifacts
pertinent to the task requires a
means of evaluating newly developed
techniques. Evaluation can be conducted
analytically if suitable corpora are
available. Unfortunately, no such corpora
exist. This chapter describes the
development of a suitable corpus
containing
software tasks
and a variety of different artifacts pertinent
to the task in which text relevant to the
task is identified.
This corpus consists of 
50 tasks comprising Android development and originating from \acf{SO} questions
as well as from GitHub issues from a variety of Android Open-Source Systems.

Figure~\ref{fig:corpus-creation-pipeline}
summarizes the process we use to create the corpus.
We randomly sample a set of Android development tasks from two common
task sources, GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/}} and Stack Overflow\footnote{\url{https://stackoverflow.com/}}.
For each of these tasks, we use the Google search engine to find potential artifacts that likely contain relevant
information for that task in top-ranked Android development websites. 
We parse the content (i.e., natural language English text) of obtained artifacts 
and we rely of the input of experienced 
software developers for the identification of the text relevant to a task.
We detail each of these steps in turn in 
Sections~\ref{cp4:corpus-tasks},~\ref{cp4:corpus-artifacts} and ~\ref{cp4:corpus-relevant-text}.
We provide a summary of the final created corpus we call \acs{DS-android} corpus in Section~\ref{cp4:corpus-summary}.
