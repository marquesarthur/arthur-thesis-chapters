\chapter{Android Task Corpus}
\label{ch:android-corpus}




To produce a solution for a task, a developer engages in a variety of
information-seeking activities.  One of these activities involves
the identification of relevant text in artifacts. In this
paper, we focus primarily on the results of this activity,
considering which
text, from a variety of different artifact types, developers deem
relevant to working on for a particular software task.


One of the challenges for characterizing task-relevant information as well as for proposing automatic techniques to automatically identify task-relevant text is
the lack of large corpora containing
software tasks and associated artifacts originating from heterogeneous sources.

\red{statement about the relevant sentences here}


To fill this gap, this chapter contributes with the Android tasks corpus (\textbf{\acs{DS-android}}), a dataset with 300 tasks comprising Android development and originating from Stack Overflow questions
as well as from GitHub issues on a variety of Android Open-Source Systems.



\red{add more motivation here}


This chapter main contributions are \textit{(i)} the procedures for the corpus creation, and; \textit{(ii)} the corpus itself. A well-structured corpus lays the foundation for several studies that explore relationships between software tasks, natural language artifacts, and text within these artifacts. \red{eval \& corpus summary}
