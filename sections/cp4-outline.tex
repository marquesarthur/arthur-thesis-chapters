\chapter{Android Task Corpus}
\label{ch:android-corpus}



% ART: move to an early chapter
% To produce a solution for a task, a developer engages in a variety of
% information-seeking activities.  One of these activities involves
% the identification of  text in artifacts \gm{relevant to helping solve the task}.

Developing techniques that can automatically identify text
relevant to a task requires a means of evaluating whether
a proposed technique works well. In this context,
``working well'' refers to whether the text identified
by an automatic technique is similar to text considered
by humans as being relevant to a task at hand. To support
the evaluation of proposed techniques, a corpus
are needed that include tasks to be performed on
systems, artifacts representing different kinds of information
that would be useful to humans performing the tasks
and an identification of text in those artifacts that
is helpful to the humans.

As we have described earlier in this thesis, while there
exist techniques tuned to identifying relevant text in
specific artifact types, there are not techniques able to
identify text across a range of artifact types. Thus,
the corpa that exist consist of tasks with only single,
or a small number, of types of artifacts. As a result,
there was a need to create a corpa that included
multiple artifacts types for a task. This chapter describes the
development of a corpus that overcomes the limitations of
existing corpa, bringing together tasks from an existing
well-known domain, Android development, with relevant text
for solving that task from multiple artifact types.


Figure~\ref{fig:corpus-creation-pipeline}
summarizes the process we use to create the corpus, which we call \acs{DS-android}.
We randomly sample a set of 50 Android development tasks from two common
task sources, GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/}} and Stack Overflow\footnote{\url{https://stackoverflow.com/}}.
For each of these tasks, we use the Google search engine to find potential artifacts that likely contain relevant
information for that task in top-ranked Android development websites. 
We then gather task-relevant sentences from these artifacts
from experienced developers.
We detail each of these steps in turn in 
Sections~\ref{cp4:corpus-tasks},~\ref{cp4:corpus-artifacts} and ~\ref{cp4:corpus-relevant-text}.
We provide a summary of the final created corpus in Section~\ref{cp4:corpus-summary}.



We publicly share the corpus to help future research in the field~\cite{supplementary_material}.

% In \circled{1}, we obtain a set of software tasks. For each task, pertinent artifacts are fetched in \circled{2}. In \circled{3}, text relevant to the task is identified by experts
