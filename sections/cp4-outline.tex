\chapter{Android Task Corpus}
\label{ch:android-corpus}




To produce a solution for a task, a developer engages in a variety of
information-seeking activities.  One of these activities involves
the identification of  text in artifacts \gm{relevant to helping solve the task}.

\gm{Probably you can just start here as above
should be clear at this point in the thesis...
The development of techniques
to automate the identification of text
in relevant to solving a task in artifacts
pertinent to the task requires a
means of evaluating newly developed
techniques. Evaluation can be conducted
analytically if suitable corpa are
available. Unfortunately, no such corpa
exist. This chapter describes the
development of a suitable corpus
containing
software tasks
and a variety of different artifacts pertinent
to the task in which text relevant to the
task is identified.}
This corpus consists of 
%To fill this gap, 
%this chapter contributes with 
%a set of procedures used to create
%the Android tasks corpus %(\textbf{\acs{DS-android}}), a dataset with 
300 tasks comprising Android development and originating from Stack Overflow questions
as well as from GitHub issues from a variety of Android Open-Source Systems.

Figure~\ref{fig:corpus-creation-pipeline}
summarizes \gm{the process we use to create the corpus.} 
We randomly sample a set of Android development tasks from \gm{two common
task sources}, GitHub\footnote{\url{}} and Stack Overflow\footnote{\url{}}.
For each of these tasks, we use the Google search engine to find potential artifacts that likely contain relevant
information for that task. For these artifacts, we apply state-of-the-art techniques to detect the relevant text.
\gm{Don't you also choose other artifacts?}
We detail each of these steps in turn in 
Sections~\ref{cp4:corpus-tasks},~\ref{cp4:corpus-artifacts} and ~\ref{cp4:corpus-relevant-text}
%provide details to each of these steps, respectively.
We provide a summary of the final created corpus we call \acs{DS-android} corpus in Section~\ref{cp4:corpus-summary}.

\gm{Pointer to how to get
the corpus online right up front?}
