\chapter{Android Task Corpus}
\label{ch:identifying}



\vspace{1mm}

--- One of the challenges for characterizing task-relevant information as well as for proposing automatic techniques to automatically identify task-relevant text is 
the lack of large corpora containing 
software tasks and associated artifacts originating from heterogeneous sources.


--- To fill this gap, this chapter contributes with the Andorid tasks corpus (\textbf{\acs{DS-android}}), a dataset with 300 tasks originating from StackOverflow questions comprising Andorid development
as well as from GitHub issues on a variety of Android Open-Source Systems. 



--- Creating a foundation, well-structured corpus is itself a contribution to scientific progress. It lays the foundation 
for several studies that explore relationships between software tasks and natural language artifacts. Therefore, we describe our methodology for the creation of such a corpus.


\section{Motivation}
\textcolor{white}{force ident} % this is just for the chapter outline

--- Describe existing corpora and why they are not sufficient for our domain problem

\section{Methodology}
\textcolor{white}{force ident} % this is just for the chapter outline

--- Provide an overview of the corpus creation procedures 


\subsection{Software Tasks}
\textcolor{white}{force ident} % this is just for the chapter outline

--- We consider a software task as a piece of work undertaken by a developer that often has to be finished within a certain time~\cite{2004merriam}. 
Two common places a software task can be found are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the description of a bug or feature request reported in a bug tracking systems; or in
    \item a post in a community forum, development mailing lists, and others.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}

--- Given this definition, we select tasks from StackOverflow and GitHub to build our corpus

------ We scope task selection to the \textit{Android} development domain such that we can select common tasks across the two sources \vspace{3mm}


\subsubsection{StackOverflow tasks}
\textcolor{white}{force ident} % this is just for the chapter outline

--- Detail that StackOverflow tasks were selected from Baltes et al. dataset~\cite{baltes2019-rep}

------ Give example of a StackOverflow task \vspace{5mm}

\subsubsection{GitHub tasks}
\textcolor{white}{force ident} % this is just for the chapter outline

--- Because there is no GitHub dataset promptly available, we selected GitHub issues from top starred Android projects on GitHub 

------ Projects were selected among Open Source Systems that had the \textit{Java} and \textit{Android} tags. 

------ We randomly sampled 15 issues from a total of 10 distinct projects

------ Describe how we avoid common pitfalls  when mining GitHub~\cite{kalliamvakou2014}

------ Give example of a GitHub task 

\subsection{Artifact Selection}
\label{cp4:corpus-artifacts}
\textcolor{white}{force ident} % this is just for the chapter outline


--- Our artifact selection approach seeks to simulate everyday practices on how developers search the Web~\cite{rao2020, Xia2017} \vspace{3mm}


\subsubsection{Artifact sources}
\textcolor{white}{force ident} % this is just for the chapter outline

--- As there are many different sources of artifacts, we restrict artifact selection to well known and studied sources~\cite{Starke2009,Kevic2014, Li2013}:


\begin{itemize}
    \item Android and Java SE API documentation;
    \item Github issues;
    \item StackOverflow answers; and
    \item Web tutorials or blog posts from java and android development.
\end{itemize}


\vspace{3mm}


\subsubsection{Query formulation}
\textcolor{white}{force ident} % this is just for the chapter outline

--- To that end, we consider a task's title (i.e., SO question or GitHub issue title) as the seed used to search for pertinent artifacts in a search engine

------ This is a common procedure adopted by many studies in the field (e.g.,~\cite{Xu2017} or ~\cite{Silva2019}). \vspace{3mm}


--- For these sources, we use the \texttt{googlesearch} API~\cite{googlesearch} to perform Web searches


\subsubsection{Artifact selection}
\textcolor{white}{force ident} % this is just for the chapter outline

--- We fetch a maximum of 5 resources per artifact source --- a limitation necessary due to throttling or even blocking mechanisms in the APIs used the fetch data \vspace{3mm}

--- We exclude results that do not appear in Alexa~\cite{alexa} Java and Android categories in the period from 2020/04/01
to 2021/03/01





\subsection{Corpus Summary}
\textcolor{white}{force ident} % this is just for the chapter outline


--- Summary of contributions for the chapter \vspace{3mm}

------ A corpus containing 300 software tasks originating from StackOverflow and Github and associated artifacts containing potentially relevant information to correctly completing the task \vspace{3mm}

------ Methodology for the corpus creation as well as a replication package with the scripts used to create the Android task corpus \vspace{3mm}


--- Provide descriptive summary of the corpus

------ 300 tasks, 150 from SO and 150 from Git

------ Approximately 2,500 artifacts

------ Almost 260,000 sentences
