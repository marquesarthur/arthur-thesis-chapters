\chapter{Android Task Corpus}
\label{ch:android-corpus}




To produce a solution for a task, a developer engages in a variety of
information-seeking activities.  One of these activities involves
the identification of relevant text in artifacts
and one of the challenges for proposing automatic solutions to 
assist developers in this activity
is
the lack of corpora containing
software tasks, 
and text, from a variety of different artifact types, that developers deem
relevant to that task.




To fill this gap, 
this chapter contributes with 
a set of procedures used to create
the Android tasks corpus (\textbf{\acs{DS-android}}), a dataset with 300 tasks comprising Android development and originating from Stack Overflow questions
as well as from GitHub issues from a variety of Android Open-Source Systems.




Figure~\ref{fig:corpus-creation-pipeline}
summarizes our corpus creation pipeline.
We randomly sample a set of Android development tasks from Stack Overflow and GitHub.
For each of these tasks, we use the Google search engine to find potential resources that might have
text relevant for that task. For these resources, we apply state-of-the-art techniques to detect the relevant text.
Sections~\ref{cp4:corpus-tasks},~\ref{cp4:corpus-artifacts} and ~\ref{cp4:corpus-relevant-text}
provide details to each of these steps, respectively.
Section~\ref{cp4:corpus-summary} provides a summary for the \acs{DS-android} corpus.
