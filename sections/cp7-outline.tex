\chapter{Discussion and Future Work}
\label{ch:discussion}

In conducting the studies reported on in
this dissertation and in developing the
techniques explored, we made many decisions.
In this chapter, we discuss the limitations
and trade-offs that resulted and discuss
future avenues for exploration.

%In this chapter, we discuss questions
%and decisions not addressed in the previous chapters of this dissertation. 
%We also use this discussion to describe potential venues for future work.

% characterization of task-relevant text across multiple artifact types,
% in the design of the semantic-based techniques that we have explored, 
% or in our empirical evaluation of \acs{tool}.



 


% potential improvements to the semantic-based
% techniques. We also introduce potential tools
% that can leverage the broader applicability
% of the semantic-based techniques.
