\chapter{Evaluating a Semantic-based Automated Approach to Task-Relevant Text Identification}
\label{ch:assisting}


In the last chapter, we showed that semantic-based approaches can help identify text in artifacts relevant to a task. 
In this chapter, we consider whether one of these approaches---\textit{BERT with no filters}---can assist a software developer while they \textit{work} on a task.


To perform this evaluation, we embed the BERT with no filters approach into a web browser plug-in that  highlights 
text relevant to a particular software task in web pages inspected by a developer.
We investigate whether this tool, which we call \acs{tool}, aids developers through a controlled experiment,
thus addressing whether developers can effectively complete a software task 
when provided with task-relevant text  extracted from natural language artifacts. 
We report how  24 participants completed three Python programming tasks 
with and without \acs{tool}.
Our results show that participants considered the majority of the text  identified automatically in the artifacts 
they perused useful and that 
the tool assisted them in producing a more correct solution for one of the experimental tasks.



We start by outlining the evaluation approach  (Section~\ref{cp6:method}). We then
detail experimental procedures  (Section~\ref{cp6:experiment}) before reporting
results from the experiment 
(Section~\ref{cp6:results}).
Section~\ref{cp6:summary} concludes the chapter.

% \gcm{Sorry if I missed it but do you outline the number of artifacts and type of artifacts per task?}
% \art{sorry. I will add that to the Artifacts session}



% \art{I'm trying to set results in a manner similar to how we did in the  (``Task-Relevant Knowledge Identification'')ICPC paper---present an overview of what we evaluate in the section, describe the method of evaluation and then, the results.}
