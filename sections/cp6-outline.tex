\chapter{Identifying Task-Relevant Text}
\label{ch:assisting}


% A developer can more effectively complete a software development task when automatically provided with text relevant to their task extracted from pertinent natural language artifacts and represented in a concise and thorough way.  

% \textbf{Thesis statement:} \textit{
%     Information relevant to a software development task can be automatically extracted from natural 
%     language software artifacts by interpreting the meaning, or semantics, of the text in these artifacts.
%     This task-relevant text assists a developer in effectively completing their software development task.

\red{Notes and suggestions from the couple last meetings}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Find open-source tasks from Github projects. It will be easier to justify validity of the tasks
    \item It can be Javascript, Python, or Android
    \item Procedures: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item one task without tool, two with 
        \item try to be consistent over all tasks performed
        \item ??
    \end{itemize}
    \item Risks: How to minimize risks if tool support is not helpful?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ask participants to highlight text that assisted them complete the task?
        \item ask participants about qualitative feedback on the highlights shown?
        \item something different
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% % \textbf{Thesis statement:} 
% \textit{
%     ``A developer can more effectively complete a software development task when provided
%     with text that automatic techniques determine as relevant to the developer's task 
%     according to the meaning, or semantics, of the text.''

% Chapter needs to show that a semantic-based technique from previous chapter assists a 
% developer effectively complete their task. Must define \textit{effectively}: 

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item correct: the solution for the task meets some correctness criteria, e.g., it meets expectations from a unit test
%     \item complete: the solution meets some completeness criteria, e.g., it passes `\textit{all}' expected unit tests
% \end{itemize}


% This leads to a `within subjects' or `between subjects' evaluation where we assess whether 
% a developer's solution is more correct or complete
%  when assisted by a tool that embeds one semantic-based technique.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item independent variable: task done with or without tool
% \item dependent variable(s): completeness and correctness of the task
% \end{itemize}
