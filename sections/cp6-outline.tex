\chapter{Evaluating Text Automatically Identified}
\label{ch:assisting}




Previously, we have compared different semantic-based techniques for automatically identifying text relevant to a software task.
Although such a comparison assisted us in determining the most promising approaches among the different techniques that we have explored, it did not address whether 
the text automatically identified  
can assist a software developer while working on a task.



To fill this gap, this chapter presents a controlled experiment that 
investigates how a tool that embeds a semantic-based techniques 
might impact how a developer works on a task. 
With this experiment, we report qualitative and quantitative aspects related to participants who attempted these tasks using
(or not) a tool that could automatically highlight text that it  determined as relevant to the participant's task. 





We start by outlining factors that guided the design of the experiment (Section~\ref{cp6:method}) and then 
by detailing experimental procedures (Sections~\ref{cp6:experiment}).
Section~\ref{cp6:results} reports results from the experiment as well as threats to its validity.
Section~\ref{cp6:summary} concludes the chapter.
