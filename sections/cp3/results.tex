\section{Results}
\label{cp3:results}


In this section, we present experimental results. 
First, we describe the data produced
and 
then, we analyze properties of the text considered relevant. 
We also report results from our interview analysis.

\subsection{Summary of Results}


The results we obtained 
from the analysis of highlights produced by 
developers inspecting artifacts 
pertinent to six software tasks indicate that
between 1\% to 20\% of the text of an artifact was considered
relevant to a task.
While we failed to observe syntactic cues 
that could indicate the relevance of text to a task, 
we observe consistency in the meaning of the relevant text---as captured using frame semantics---suggesting that semantic-based approaches 
may be more appropriate for the 
automatic identification of task-relevant text.
