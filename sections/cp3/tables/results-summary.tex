    Text perceived as relevant by more participants likely relates to key information for completing a task whereas information 
    highlighted by a few participants may be more dependent on the knowledge of individuals.

\textit{O2}
& \parbox[c][1.7cm][c]{7.3cm}{
    There are recurring semantic meanings in relevant sentences,
    suggesting commonalities in their conveyed information
    and indicating that text might be identified through its semantics.
}
\\

\textit{O3} 
& \parbox[c][2.0cm][c]{7.3cm}{
    The prominence of certain semantic meanings in some types 
    of artifacts or tasks suggest that, if an artifact/task type is known,
    one can fine-tune the identification of relevant information within 
    that artifact and/or task.

\textit{O4}
& \parbox[c][1.7cm][c]{7.3cm}{
    Developers use mixed strategies to locate task-relevant information,
     often missing some information that might be relevant 
     to complete a task completely and correctly.
