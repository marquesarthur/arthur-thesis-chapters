    \textbf{Current behaviour:} No lock screen controls ever on this phone and never seen them working (or on preceding Huawei P8). Notification controls always work, never had problems. Lock screen controls fine for all other apps without tweaking, same on old P8. I have loosened all notification and lock screen limits, removed power management, etc., but no luck ever. I've also tried setting to use different players, but change in behaviour. \ldots
