\label{cp4:corpus-artifacts}


When selecting artifacts pertinent to a task in our corpus, we seek to simulate everyday practices on how developers search the Web~\cite{rao2020, Xia2017}.
We formulate a query for each task and use a Web search engine to retrieve artifacts that are pertinent to that task, as described below.


\subsubsection{Artifact sources}

% \gm{Aren't most of these artifact
% types chosen because there are existing
% techniques? Have you considered doing
% this more empirically - report on the
% kinds of artifact types and select
% most common?}


The artifacts sought to find useful information or knowledge for completing a task
highly depend on the type of task a developer performs.
For example, when using a new framework or library, a developer refers to official API documentation more often~\cite{Li2013,robillard2011field} while, for debugging or error diagnostic tasks, community-based sources are preferred~\cite{Li2013,Breu2010}.
Despite such variability, researchers have observed that 
technical blogs, API documentation, and community forums are sources
commonly used by developer to forage information~\cite{Li2013, josyula2018}.



We use this knowledge to restrict artifact selection to well-known and studied artifacts within these sources~\cite{Starke2009,Kevic2014, Li2013}, namely
Android and Java SE API documentation, Github issues, Stack Overflow answers; and Web tutorials or blog posts from Java and Android development.





\subsubsection{Query formulation}


%  \gm{Seems like
% motivation that is in next paragraph
% should come first.}


Coming up with proper search terms is a critical step of any search~\cite{Haiduc2013}
and, ideally, we should be able to formulate a query with terms able to retrieve the most pertinent artifacts for a software task.
However, studies have shown that developers perform poorly in identifying good search terms~\cite{Starke2009,Kevic2014} and thus, using a task's title
as an educated approximation to terms that a developer might use is a common procedure adopted by other studies in the field (e.g.,~\cite{Xu2017} or ~\cite{Silva2019}).
Hence, we use a task's title (i.e., SO question or GitHub issue title) as the seed to search for pertinent artifacts.



\subsubsection{Search results}


We use \texttt{googlesearch} API~\cite{googlesearch} to get the results of a query. 
We fetch a maximum of 5 resources per artifact source --- a limitation necessary due to throttling or even blocking mechanisms in the APIs used to get the content of each source considered.
\gm{Isn't the real reason because you
don't want more?}
\art{I think it's both. I don't want more and there's throttling/IP blocking}


When selecting results, we exclude any result that does not appear in the Amazon Alexa~\cite{alexa} Web traffic for Java and Android development in the period from April 2020 to March 2021\footnote{\red{Review filter --- it may be too strict at the moment}}. 
While applying this filter potentially decreased the number of artifacts per task, it ensured that results were indeed related to Android development. 
For instance, for a task discussing ``\textit{left and right-hand swap}'' 
filtering avoided fetching unrelated resources, such as a Web page on  \textit{stock swap} operations.
Table~\ref{tbl:googlesearch-example-git} shows one search result per artifact source for the GitHub task introduced in Section~\ref{cp4:corpus-tasks}.

\subsubsection{Artifact's content}

\gm{Explain why you have to do this step.}

Processing an artifact's content into a sequence of individual sentences 
followed procedures analogous to other studies in the field~\cite{Arya2019, nadi2020}.
Given a search result \texttt{URL}, we use \texttt{BeautifulSoup}~\cite{beautifulsoup4},
\texttt{StackAPI}~\cite{StackAPI} and \texttt{PyGithub}~\cite{PyGithub}
to fetch the artifacts' content. Sentences in each paragraph
were identified using the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit~\cite{CoreNLP}.
