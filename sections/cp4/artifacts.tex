\section{Artifact Selection}
\label{cp4:corpus-artifacts}


When selecting artifacts pertinent to a task in our corpus, we seek to simulate everyday practices on how developers search the Web~\cite{rao2020, Xia2017}. That is, our corpus creation pipeline formulates a query for each task and uses a Web search engine to retrieve artifacts that are pertinent to that task, as described below.


\subsubsection{Artifact sources}

As there are many different sources of artifacts, we restrict artifact selection to well known and studied sources~\cite{Starke2009,Kevic2014, Li2013}, i.e.,
Android and Java SE API documentation, Github issues, Stack Overflow answers; and Web tutorials or blog posts from Java and Android development.



\subsubsection{Query formulation}



We consider a task's title (i.e., SO question or GitHub issue title) as the seed used to search artifacts
using the \texttt{googlesearch} API~\cite{googlesearch}.


Coming up with proper search terms is a critical step of any search~\cite{Haiduc2013}
and, ideally, we should be able to formulate a query with terms able to retrieve the most pertinent artifacts for a software task.
However, studies have shown that developers perform poorly in identifying good search terms~\cite{Starke2009,Kevic2014, Li2013} and thus, using a task's title
as an educated approximation to terms that a developer might use is a common procedure adopted by other studies in the field (e.g.,~\cite{Xu2017} or ~\cite{Silva2019}).







\subsubsection{Search results}


We fetch a maximum of 5 resources per artifact source --- a limitation necessary due to throttling or even blocking mechanisms in the APIs used to get the content of each source considered. 


When selecting results, we exclude any result that does not appear in the Amazon Alexa~\cite{alexa} Web traffic for Java and Android development in the period from April 2020 to March 2021\footnote{\red{Review filter --- it may be too strict at the moment}}. 
While applying this filter potentially decreased the number of artifacts per task, it ensured that results were indeed related to Android development. 
For instance, for a task discussing ``\textit{left and right-hand swap}'' 
filtering avoided fetching unrelated resources, such as a Web page on  \textit{stock swap} operations.
Table~\ref{tbl:googlesearch-example-git} shows one search result per artifact source for the GitHub task introduced in Section~\ref{cp4:corpus-tasks}.

\subsubsection{Artifact's content}


Processing an artifact's content into a sequence of individual sentences 
followed procedures analogous to other studies in the field~\cite{Arya2019, nadi2020}.
Given a search result \texttt{URL}, we use \texttt{BeautifulSoup}~\cite{beautifulsoup4},
\texttt{StackAPI}~\cite{StackAPI} and \texttt{PyGithub}~\cite{PyGithub}
to fetch the artifacts' content. Sentences in each paragraph
were identified using the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit~\cite{CoreNLP}.
