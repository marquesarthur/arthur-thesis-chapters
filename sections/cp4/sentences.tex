\label{cp4:corpus-relevant-text}






Next, we need to determine which 
of the text in the gathered artifacts could provide information that assists a developer in solving her task.
In our corpus, this text represents \textit{golden data} that one can use to design and evaluate automatic tools that assist developers in the identification of information useful to their tasks. 
To produce it, we 
ask experienced developers to
mark the text that they deem useful and that provide information for tasks assigned to them~\cite{nadi2020, Robillard2015, marques2020}.



\subsection{Annotation process}


Our intention is that golden data reflect text that instructs developers to perform important actions to accomplish their task~\cite{Robillard2015, Lotufo2012}.
To this end, we describe the annotators' background, annotation procedures, and the 
the text inspected by the annotators.

\subsubsection{Annotators}


We recruited 3 graduate students with professional programming experience to produce \textit{golden} data for our corpus. Annotators had to have experience with Java development and they also had to be familiar with the types of artifacts they would encounter throughout the annotation process. 
On average, annotators self-reported 3.0 years of professional
programming experience (stdv 1.63, ranging from 1 to 5 years).



\subsubsection{Annotation procedures}



We divided tasks into batches of 10 tasks each as to avoid fatigue effects~\cite{Ponzanelli2017}. For each batch, annotators had task descriptions and links to artifacts pertinent to the respective task at their disposal. We asked annotators to write a short plan (250 words max~\cite{Rastkar2010}) with instructions that a developer could follow to complete the task successfully. 
The purpose of the plan was to ensure that annotators built enough context about the task.
While perusing artifacts, annotators also had to manually highlight sentences that they deemed useful and that provided information that assisted task completion---instructions similar to the ones used for the creation of the data in the \acs{DS-synthetic} corpus~\cite{marques2020}.


The annotation process was facilitated by a tool we created for this purpose. Figure~\ref{fig:corpus-annotation-tool} shows a screenshot from the tool in 
action, which works as a browser plug-in. The top-right corner panel in the figure shows the browser extension. When an annotator clicked the \texttt{highlight} button, 
the tool instrumented the HTML of a page identifying individual sentences. The tool then allowed annotators to hover over identified sentences and to select them as relevant by clicking on the hovered text. For example, in the first paragraph, an annotator selected  the sentence
``\textit{Call ActivityOptions.setLockTaskEnabled() ... when starting the activity}'' as relevant to the Android lock task (Figure~\ref{fig:lock-screen-task}).

\end{figure}




\subsubsection{Text inspected}





Annotators had to inspect a total of 12,401 sentences originating from API documentation, Stack Overflow answers, GitHub issue discussion and miscellaneous Web pages.
These sentences comprise natural language written text---in this case, English---and do not involve source code snippets that may appear alongside the text.


Table~\ref{tbl:corpus-summary} gives insight into the number of sentences inspected per artifact type. 
We observe that API documents and miscellaneous Web pages contain the highest number of sentences in our corpus.
This is not surprising because API documents often contain boilerplate text 
and all the information needed for the usage of an API element is usually found in a single document~\cite{robillard2011field}.
Miscellaneous Web pages comprise blogs or tutorials, 
which often provide step-by-step instructions and accompanying examples, 
what likely explains the large number of sentences for this type of artifact~\cite{arya2020, Jiang2016b}.


The content of GitHub issues mostly resembles conversations~\cite{Rastkar2010}
and, beyond code snippets and minimal structured fields, the 
1,890 sentences inspected in this type of artifact comprise the description of a reported bug or a feature request as well as questions, answers, and discussion from  community members who are interested in resolving the issue at hand~\cite{zimmermann2010}.



For SO answers, the fewer number of inspected sentences (1,420) potentially relates to 
the fact that Stack Overflow offers little incentive for further discussion once a post has been answered.
Nonetheless, it is worthy noting that sentences with crucial information 
are not limited to the ones in an accepted answer~\cite{nadi2020}
and that later comments can be equally or more informative,
often providing notes about updates in an API component or framework~\cite{zhang2019so}.

\subsection{Corpus Description}

% \gm{The important point here is what
% is in the corpus - all sentences marked by annotators and who marked which?}


% \gm{Need to move table up so it is Table 4.3} -- OK
We structure tasks and annotation results in a format similar to the one shown in 
Table~\ref{tbl:corpus-data-structure}. 
Each task has a  title, link, description, and a set of pertinent artifacts.
In turn, each artifact has a type, title, link, and content,
where each sentence within an artifact's content
is preceded by the set of 
annotators (i.e., \texttt{none}, \texttt{A1}, \texttt{A2}, or \texttt{A3}) who marked the sentence as useful to the task.
As an example, in a Stack Overflow answer (artifact$_2$), all three annotators 
marked the sentence ``\textit{Have you checked RemoteControlClient?}''
as relevant to the lock mode task.

Overall, annotation required a total of $\approx60$ hours of manual work and it was done throughout the course of 4 weeks.
Table~\ref{tbl:corpus-annotation-summary} provides summary statistics for the text marked by 
the annotators over all the artifacts inspected as well as on an artifact type basis.

Table~\ref{tbl:corpus-summary} summarizes results from the corpus annotation.
On average the text deemed useful to a software task in the artifacts inspected comprises 
\red{8.88} sentences. 
We observe that the highest number of sentences marked originate from miscellaneous artifacts
while the lowest come from GitHub issue discussions. 
The high number of sentences marked in the former might relate to the fact that tutorials 
dilute and exemplify much of the information that a developer would find in official API documentation~\cite{arya2020, Jiang2017}.
For the latter, the content on GitHub may be too project-specific and thus, 
a developer trying to find information useful for her task in this source
may have to prune large amounts of project-specific discussions to find the
pieces that interest her.}

\rev{
To identify if data in the corpus can be homogeneously used for evaluation purposes,
we divide the number of sentences marked according to a task's origin, as Tables~\ref{tbl:corpus-annotation-summary-by-task} shows.
We use a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test~\cite{mannWhitneyU} to check if there are any statistically significant differences between the number of sentences marked in 
GitHub and Stack Overflow task.
Results show a statistically significant difference 
between the number of sentences 
marked with a medium effect size~\cite{cohen2013statistical}.
Based on this analysis, later evaluation provides results considering
both the entirety of the data as well as on a per type of task basis.

\rev{
Table~\ref{tbl:corpus-summary} also reports the percentage of sentences marked by one, two or three annotators since individuals might use different criteria to
assess the usefulness of a sentence to a given task~\cite{Barry1994, Barry1998}.
Out of 1145
unique marked
sentences, 
10\% were marked by all annotators,
20\% by two of them and the remainder---801 sentences---by a single annotator.
These ratios follow Nenkova and Passonneau's empirical findings on 
content selection~\cite{Nenkova2004}
and are a similar to the ratios in the \acs{DS-synthetic} corpus,
where sentences marked by a single annotator comprise the majority of the data.}



% Following our analysis through the annotators' perspective,
\rev{
Table~\ref{tbl:corpus-summary-per-annotator} provides further details on the annotators' background and the text marked by each individual. 
An average of 529.33 sentences were marked by the annotators (std 126.34) and 
we observe differences in the text marked.
For example,
the most experienced annotator---with 5 years of professional programming experience---had the
least amount of text marked while less experienced ones leaned towards selecting more sentences.
Although we leave the in-depth analysis of how an individual's background plays a role in what they perceive as relevant for future studies, the differences observed
suggest that no unique set of task-relevant text exists~\cite{Nenkova2004} and that evaluation metrics should clearly outline how they make use of the golden data
in our corpus to assess techniques that can automatically identify text relevant to a task.
