\section{Threats to Validity}
\label{cp6:threats}


--- Nature of the tasks, if tasks were not necessarily programming tasks, the text selected by participants might have been different


--- Our experiment follows a \textit{between groups} design~\cite{Lazar2017-cp3}, i.e., we compare data gathered from the participants who did a manual task 
 to data from participants who did the same task assisted by our tool. Discuss risks associated with this type of design
