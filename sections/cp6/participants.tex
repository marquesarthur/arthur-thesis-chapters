We advertised our study to both developers in our professional network and to computer science students at the several universities. 
This provides for breadth of experience where both novice and expert developers attempt the tasks in our experiment. 


With regards to computer science students, we sent the study only to third and fourth-year students to ensure that they had the necessary background required to perform the study's taks.
At this point in the curriculum, students should be familiar with Python and they should be able to come up with a solution 
for a software task when provided with artifacts containing information for that task.


To compensate participants for their time, we offered them the opportunity to enter a raffle for one of two iPads 64 GB.
