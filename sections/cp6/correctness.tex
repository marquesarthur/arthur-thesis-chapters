\subsection{Method}



\subsection{Results}
 
The correctness of a submitted solution is measured by the number of passing test cases
when running that solution against a set of 10 test cases. 
A solution with compile errors has a correctness score of zero.

\begin{small}


\begin{equation}
    Correctness = \frac{ \text{\textit{\# of passing test cases}}}{\text{\textit{\#  of test cases}}}
