\label{cp6:results}

We organize results by assessing the solutions submitted by the participants
and their ratings on the usefulness of the highlights shown 
in each artifact of each task. We also compare manually and automatically identified text.

% \gcm{Seems like the usefulness of highlights is more important than
% the comparison.}
% \art{clarify - in the intro it's suggested that I should de-emphasize the comparison, but in this section there's a comment asking to move usefulness before the comparison }

\subsection{Summary of Results}


The preliminary results we obtained suggest that 
an automatic approach to task-relevant text identification
assists 
developers in completing software tasks. 
\rev{On average, the solutions of participants assisted by \acs{tool} were as or more correct than those of participants without tool support.}
Participants \rev{also} found the text automatically identified
useful in two out of the three types of artifacts that they inspected, 
namely API documents and Stack Overflow posts, and; 
for the task that required using more modules and functions (\texttt{titanic}),
participants who used \acs{tool} also produced more correct results.
