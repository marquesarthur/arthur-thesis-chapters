\label{cp6:results}

We organize results assessing the solutions submitted by the participants, 
comparing manual and automatically identified text as well as discussing the usefulness of the highlights shown 
by the study's tool.

\subsection{Summary of results}


Results from our experiment suggest that
participants find the text automatically identified
most useful when the semantic based technique applied by our tool 
identifies text that humans deemed relevant to a task.
In such scenario, we observe that participants 
produced more correct solutions. 
However, when it failed to detect the text deemed relevant,
participants found the tool's output not as useful and 
their solutions had more errors. 
These results suggests that our tool might positively or negatively 
impact how a developer completes a task.
