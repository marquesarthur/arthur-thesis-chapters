\label{cp6:procedures}



Each experimental session lasted no more than two hours; this length of time was selected based on two pilot sessions. 
Feedback from these pilots also helped to refine the experiment's instructions, where we included a short video showing how to install the web browser plugin and how to use Colab, the online environment where participants performed each task (Section~\ref{cp6:environment}).






We began each session gathering consent and requesting participants to install a web browser plugin which we used to gather data.
Setup was followed by a short tutorial explaining the experiment and describing how to use the plugin and Colab. 
The practice task allowed participants to familiarize themselves with the content of a task, the web browser plugin and Colab. 



For each task, including the practice tasks, we asked a participant to write a solution for the task
when provided with a fixed set of artifacts, e.g., official API documentation, Stack Overflow posts, or web tutorials, 
associated with that task.  


\subsection{Manual Task}



In the control task, a participant was instructed to use the web browser plugin to highlight any text that they deemed relevant to the task-at-hand. 
\gm{Do they highlight text as they
work or after the task?}

\subsection{Manual Task}

In the tool assisted task, the plugin automatically highlighted sentences that our semantic-based technique identified as relevant for the task. 
For this second task, we had one extra step asking the participant to rate---using a Likert scale---how helpful were the highlights automatically identified per artifact available. 
\gm{More detail about exactly
what participants were asked to
do and experimental materials
should be published or in Appendix
of thesis.}


We concluded the study by asking participants if they would like to provide any additional information and 
by giving them the opportunity to join the raffle, if so they wished. 



\subsection{Summary of procedures}



Table~\ref{tbl:experiment-data} summarizes the data we collected based on experimental procedures.
We use the gathered data to investigate our main hypotheses according to the following metrics.
