\art{ask about summary and better way to position conclusions from the experiment}

In this chapter, we presented an experiment to evaluate whether a tool that embeds a semantic-based technique assists a developer working on a software task. 
The experiment examined how 24 participants with software development background attempted 
two programming tasks with or without such a tool. 
Results from this experiment indicate that, when the semantic-based approach applied by the tool identifies much of the text that humans deem relevant to a task, participants were able to produce solutions more correct than the ones from participants without the tool. 
\gcm{But only for one task...}
Likewise, failing to identify the text deemed relevant led to solutions with more errors. 
These results encourage further exploration of semantic-based techniques.
Provided that these techniques accurately identify task-relevant text, we can embed them into tools that ultimately facilitate a developer's work.
