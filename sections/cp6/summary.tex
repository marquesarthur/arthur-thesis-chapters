% \art{ask about summary and better way to position conclusions from the experiment}

In this chapter, we presented an experiment to evaluate whether \acs{tool},
 a tool that embeds a semantic-based technique, assists a developer working on a software task. 
The experiment examined how 24 participants with software development backgrounds attempted 
two programming tasks with or without such a tool. 
Results from this experiment indicate that, 
\rev{on average, participants using \acs{tool}, produced an equally or more correct 
solution than participants who had no tool-support}.
Participants \rev{also} found the text automatically identified and shown by our tool useful in two 
out of the three types of artifacts that they consulted, where our automatic approach identified on average 58\% of the text that participants deemed relevant. 
These results encourage further exploration of semantic-based techniques, 
embedding them into tools that ultimately facilitate a developer's work.
