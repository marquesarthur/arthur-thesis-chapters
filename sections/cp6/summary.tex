In this chapter, we presented an experiment to evaluate whether a tool that embeds a semantic-based technique assists a developer working on a software task. 
The experiment examined how 24 participants with software development background attempted 
two programming tasks with or without such a tool. 
Results from this experiment indicate that, 
participants found the text automatically identified and shown by our tool useful in two 
out of the three types of artifacts that assisted them completing their assigned tasks,
where our automatic approach identified up to 58\% of the text that participants deemed relevant. 
These results encourage further exploration of semantic-based techniques, 
ambedding them into tools that ultimately facilitate a developer's work.
