    \item[procedures:] given a development task \& a maintenance task, provide a solution to the task

    
    \item[tasks:] 1 development task and 1 maintenance task. Each solvable in at most a 1 hour session
    
    -- development task: same as in~\cite{Ponzanelli2014b}---create a program that, given an URL of a webpage, an email address, and a subject for the email
    converts the HTML page into a PDF. 
    
    \textit{[this can be futher divided into smaller tasks, e.g. 1 task to download some url as a PDF and another to convert it into a PDF]}
    
    -- maintenance task: adapted from~\cite{Brandt2009a}---modify a chat room web application from HTTP to websockets \textit{[this can be futher divided into smaller tasks]}
    
    
    \item[participants:] experienced developers. Awarded an Amazon gift card as compensation
    
    \item[design:] within subjects. Independent variable is presence (or not) of the technique that highlights text that might assist in the task
    
    \item[measurement-1:] Likert scale on participant's confidence about the correctness of their answer
    
    \item[measurement-2:] Unit tests to assess the solution provided by a participant 
    
    \item[tooling:] some pseudo search engine that provides a set of URLs for each task. Highlights for each task-url are cached
    
    \item[pros:] more realistic and tasks were validated in related work

        -- unit tests give a better sense on how correct is a participant's solution

    \item[cons:]  harder to recruit participants

        -- participants do not get to perform the software task itself
