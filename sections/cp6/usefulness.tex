\section{Result: Usefulness Analysis}
\label{cp6:usefulness}




Considering that our experiment follows a \textit{between-groups} design, 
the previous results might be due to ``noise'' in the data, mostly caused by individual differences between the participants who performed a task with and without tool support~\cite{Lazar2017-cp3}, what can justify a similar level of correctness in the results; or the presence (or lack) of overlap between the manual and automatically identified 
text. 
% However, this does not imply that the tool helped participants accomplish their task. 


To further explore if the highlights shown by the tool were helpful, we also asked a participant 
to indicate whether the highlights assisted them complete their assigned task. 
In this section, we described results for this analysis. 



\subsection{Method}



\subsection{Results}



We use a diverging stacked bar chart~\cite{Heiberger2014} to analyze the  Likert scale
responses on the usefulness of the text automatically identified.


Usefulness indicates the percentage of responses agreeing or disagreeing with whether sentences
automatically highlighted assisted a participant in completing a task.


\smallskip
\begin{small}

\begin{equation}
Usefulness = \frac{
    \text{\textit{\# of responses at i}}
}{
    \text{\textit{total \# of responses}}
}
\end{equation}
        

\begin{equation*}
i \in \{ 
    \text{\textit{
        (strongly) agree, neither agree or disagree, (strongly) disagree
    }}  
\}
\end{equation*}
\end{small}





\subsubsection{Written Feedback}

 
We use qualitative methods to analyze participants' responses to the open-ended questions.
