\label{cp6:usefulness}


We use a diverging stacked bar chart~\cite{Heiberger2014} to analyze the  Likert scale
responses on the usefulness of the text automatically identified.


Usefulness indicates the percentage of responses agreeing or disagreeing with whether sentences
automatically highlighted assisted a participant in completing a task.


\smallskip
\begin{small}

\begin{equation}
Usefulness = \frac{
    \text{\textit{\# of responses at i}}
}{
    \text{\textit{total \# of responses}}
}
\end{equation}
        

\begin{equation*}
i \in \{ 
    \text{\textit{
        (strongly) agree, neither agree or disagree, (strongly) disagree
    }}  
\}
\end{equation*}
\end{small}





\subsubsection{Written Feedback}

 
We use qualitative methods to analyze participants' responses to the open-ended questions.
