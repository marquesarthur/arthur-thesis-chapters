\chapter{Identifying Task-Relevant Text}
\label{ch:identifying}



Designing an automatic technique able to identify text relevant to a task across the range of artifacts a developer might seek information on means solely using data common to these different artifacts.
We have shown how  prior work uses syntactic properties (alongside an artifact's meta-data)
to detect relevant text in specific artifact types.
We have also shown that, in a small set of tasks and artifacts, task-relevant text might be identified through its semantics.
A natural question that follows is whether we can use these properties to identify relevant text across a wide variety of software tasks and artifacts.




To answer this question, \red{we use textual properties from previous related work and of our own 
into a technique able to identify text that might contain information relevant to a particular software task}.
Through these textual properties and usage of human-annotated data produced earlier in this thesis, we 
investigate how accurately we can identify text relevant to a task and whether certain properties are better indicators of the relevance of the text.
We start by outlining related work that motivate the design of our approach in Section~\ref{cp5:motivation}.
We present details about the approach itself and the properties we make use of in Section~\ref{cp5:approaches}.
Section~\ref{cp5:evaluation} describes evaluation results while
Section~\ref{cp5:summary} summarizes our key findings.
