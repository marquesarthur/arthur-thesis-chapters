\chapter{Identifying Task-Relevant Text}

% Short motivation for the chapter

Designing an automatic technique able to identify text relevant to a task across a range of natural language artifacts means using 
properties of the text itself to determine its relevance to the task.
We have shown how  prior work uses syntactic properties (alongside an artifact's meta-data)
to detect relevant text in specific artifact types.
We have also shown that, in a small set of tasks and artifacts, task-relevant text might be identified thorough its semantics.
A natural question that follows is whether these properties 
extend across a variety of software tasks and artifacts
and how can we use them as part of an approach that 
helps developers identifying text that might assist them completing their tasks?

To answer this question, this chapter describes an 
approach 
that embeds properties from previous related work and of our own
to automate the identification of relevant text to solving a task. 
\red{Need to be upfront about it being a classfier, supervised, unsupervised, etc.}
We begin detailing our approach and the properties we make use of in Section~\ref{cp5:approaches}. 
Section~\ref{cp5:evaluation}
describes how can
\red{we use such properties to accurately
identify relevant text 
and} whether certain properties are better indicators of the relevance of the text to a task.
Section~\ref{cp5:summary} concludes summarizing our key findings.

% Our approach called \red{placeholder} opts to accurately determine relevant text within an artifact pertinent to a task such that it encourages a developer to carefully read an artifact that could have been otherwise abandoned by a developer in her search for information relevant to her task.


% We guide the design of our approach by using data produced earlier in this thesis, namely the \acs{DS-synthetic} and the \acs{DS-android} corpa, and by using existing techniques 
% able to extract text properties at the word level and sentence level. 



% \art{I want to state that ultimately, I'll have a single approach that may leverages one or more techniques --- word level + sentence level properties}
