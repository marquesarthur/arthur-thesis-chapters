\chapter{Identifying Task-Relevant Text}
\label{ch:identifying}



Designing an automatic technique able to identify text relevant to a task across the range of artifacts a developer might seek information on means solely using data common to these different artifacts.
We have shown how  prior work uses syntactic properties (alongside an artifact's meta-data)
to detect relevant text in specific artifact types.
We have also shown that, in a small set of tasks and artifacts, task-relevant text might be identified through its semantics.
A natural question that follows is whether we can use these properties to identify relevant text across a wide variety of software tasks and artifacts.




To answer this question, we explore a set of approaches from previous related work and of our own 
for the automatic identification of text that might contain information relevant to a particular software task.
Through usage of human-annotated data produced earlier in this thesis, we 
investigate how accurately can these techniques identify text relevant to software development task.
We start by outlining the hypotheses that motivate the techniques that we explore in Section~\ref{cp5:motivation}.
We present details about the techniques themselves in Section~\ref{cp5:approaches}.
Section~\ref{cp5:evaluation} describes evaluation results while
Section~\ref{cp5:summary} summarizes our key findings.
