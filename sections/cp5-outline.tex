In this chapter, we discuss the design 
of an approach able to automatically
identify text relevant to a particular task across a range of artifact types.
Our approach called \red{placeholder} opts to accurately determine relevant text within an artifact pertinent to a task such that it encourages a developer to carefully read an artifact that could have been otherwise abandoned by a developer in her search for information relevant to her task.


We guide the design of our approach by using data produced earlier in this thesis, namely the \acs{DS-synthetic} and the \acs{DS-android} corpa, and by using existing techniques 
able to extract text properties at the word level and sentence level. 
We begin detailing the techniques
we explore in Section~\ref{cp5:approaches}. 
In section Section~\ref{cp5:evaluation}, 
we make use of the \acs{DS-android} corpus
to evaluate whether the explored techniques, or their combination, 
are able to detect text that human annotators identified 
as relevant to a task. 
In turn, Section~\ref{cp5:summary} summarizes our key findings.


\art{I want to state that ultimately, I'll have a single approach that may leverages one or more techniques --- word level + sentence level properties}
