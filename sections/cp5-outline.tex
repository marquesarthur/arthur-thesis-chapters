\chapter{Identifying Task-Relevant Text}
\label{ch:identifying}

% The information a developer seeks to help aid the completion of a task typically exists
% across a range of artifacts. 
% To aid developers identify, from the large amount of text
% in these documents, just the fraction of text relevant
% to the task-at-hand, prior work has used syntactic properties of the text
% ---alongside an artifact's meta-data---
%  to identify likely relevant text (\red{Chapter~\ref{}}).
% Although effective, these techniques target specific
% types of artifacts, limiting their use across the 
% many different kinds of artifacts developers encounter
% daily in their work.



% In this chapter, we explore a design space of possible techniques building on approaches to interpret the meaning, or semantics, of text
% to identify task-relevant text across different kinds of software artifacts.
% We introduce six possible techniques that incorporate the  
% semantics of words and sentences. 
% We show that some of the proposed semantic-based techniques 
% compare to existing artifact-specific techniques 
% and that they apply to a broader set of artifacts.





% We start by outlining the hypotheses that motivate the techniques that we explore (Section~\ref{cp5:motivation}) followed by detailed descriptions of the
% techniques (Section~\ref{cp5:approaches}).
% We show how the six techniques 
% compare against state-of-the-art artifact-specific techniques and 
% their accuracy across different types of artifacts (Section~\ref{cp5:evaluation}). 
% Section~\ref{cp5:summary} summarizes our key findings.
