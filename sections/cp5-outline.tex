\chapter{Identifying Task-Relevant Text}
\label{ch:identifying}

The information a developer seeks to help aid the completion of a task typically exists
across a range of artifacts. 
From the large amount of text
in these documents, just a fraction of the text might be relevant
to the task at hand and prior work has used textual properties---alongside an artifact's meta-data---to
 identify likely relevant text to aid developers in finding task-relevant information.
Although effective, these techniques target specific
types of artifacts, limiting their use across the 
many different kinds of artifacts developers encounter
daily in their work.



In this chapter, we consider the 
semantic patterns that arise from the empirical analysis of the task-relevant text (Chapter~\ref{ch:characterizing})
and we explore a design space of possible techniques building on approaches to interpret the meaning, or semantics, of text
to identify task-relevant text across different kinds of software artifacts.
We introduce six possible techniques that incorporate the  
semantics of words and sentences. 
Using the \acs{DS-android} corpus produced in Chapter~\ref{ch:android-corpus},
we show that some of the proposed semantic-based techniques 
compare to existing artifact-specific techniques 
while applying to a broader set of types of artifacts.





We start by outlining the hypotheses that motivate the techniques that we explore (Section~\ref{cp5:motivation}) followed by detailed descriptions of the
techniques (Section~\ref{cp5:approaches}).
We show how the six techniques 
compare against state-of-the-art artifact-specific techniques and 
their accuracy across different types of artifacts (Section~\ref{cp5:evaluation}). 
Section~\ref{cp5:summary} summarizes our key findings.
