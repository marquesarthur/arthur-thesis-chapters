\chapter{Identifying Task-Relevant Text}
\label{ch:identifying}



Designing an automatic technique able to identify text relevant to a task across the range of artifacts a developer might seek information on means solely using data common to these different artifacts.
We have shown how  prior work uses syntactic properties (alongside an artifact's meta-data)
to detect relevant text in specific artifact types.
We have also shown that, in a small set of tasks and artifacts, task-relevant text might be identified through its semantics.
A natural question that follows is whether we can use these properties to identify relevant text across a wide variety of software tasks and artifacts.




To answer this question, we use textual properties from previous related work and of our own 
to design an approach able to identify text that might contain information relevant to a particular software task.
Through this approach and usage of human-annotated data produced earlier in this thesis, we 
investigate how accurately we can identify text relevant to a task and whether certain properties are better indicators of the relevance of the text.
We begin presenting details of our approach and the properties we make use of in Section~\ref{cp5:approaches}.
Section~\ref{cp5:evaluation} describes evaluation results while
Section~\ref{cp5:summary} summarizes our key findings.
