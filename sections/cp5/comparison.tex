\section{Comparison to Related Work}
\label{cp5:comparison}



\subsubsection{AnswerBot}


\acf{AnsBot} automates generation of answer summaries for a developer's task for Stack Overflow posts.

The tool uses a set of features, ranging from lexical and semantical features to features that leverage meta-data available in Stack Overflow to detect useful text that will be used in the answer summary provided by the tool. 

Given the scope of the tool, we compare the accuracy our technique to AnswerBot when identifying relevant text in 
Stack Overflow artifacts.


\subsubsection{Krec}


\acf{Krec} automates the identification of information fragments that a developer cannot afford to ignore when reading API documentation.

To detect these fragments, the tool relies on a set of word patterns that indicate if a sentence contains useful information. Hence, we compare the accuracy our our technique to Krec when detecting relevant text in API documentation.


\subsubsection{Hurried Bug Report}


\acf{Hurried} estimates the attention that a developer would hypothetically give to different sentences in a bug report. 


We consider that the text that the tool identifies as the one that a developer would attend to first most likely contains information relevant to a developer task. Hence we compare the accuracy of \acf{Hurried} to ours for the bug reports artifacts in our dataset.
