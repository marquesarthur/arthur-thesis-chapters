\section{Comparison to Related Work}
\label{cp5:comparison}


\art{My goal here is to pick a technique from literature, most likely \acs{AnsBot}, and:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item report their accuracy
    \item report our accuracy fot the same artifact type
    \item check if we have similar accuracy, better, or lower 
\end{enumerate}


\art{Discuss and compare our technique to theirs based on (3). I may need to run their technique on our dataset and report results}


% \subsubsection{AnswerBot}


% \acf{AnsBot} automates generation of answer summaries for a developer's task using answers available on Stack Overflow.

% The tool uses a set of features, ranging from textual features to features that leverage  Stack Overflow's meta-data (e.g., number of votes an answer got, if a user accepted an answer as correct, etc) to detect useful text that will be used in the answer summary provided by the tool. 

% Given the scope of the tool, we compare the accuracy our technique to AnswerBot when identifying relevant text in 
% Stack Overflow artifacts.
