\subsection{Feature evaluation}


We evaluate how each individual textual property contributes towards determining 
that a sentence in a pertinent artifact is relevant to a task 
using a \red{placeholder} test. 
Informally, the higher the test output value for a feature, the more the observed outcome (i.e., whether a sentence is relevant or not to a task) depends 
on that feature.
We use this knowledge to identify if certain features contribute more or less 
to the observed outcome.



\art{I started reading chi square, but it does not apply to the features explored because some of them are continuous. I may need to detail a simple logistic regression model to annswer this question}


\subsubsection{Results}



Table~\ref{tbl:features-chi-square} gives insight into the predictive power of each feature we use as part of our approach.
