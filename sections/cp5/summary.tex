\section{Summary}
\label{cp5:summary}



In this chapter, we introduced six semantic-based techniques 
that incorporate semantics of words and sentences
to identify task-relevant text across a range of natural language artifacts.
We compare our proposed techniques to a state-of-the-art technique, AnswerBot,
specific to Stack Overflow artifacts and 
we evaluate them using a dataset that comprises  50 software tasks about Android development for
which human annotators identified pertinent text per task across a variety of kinds of software
artifacts.
Evaluation results show that semantic-based techniques 
achieve recall comparable to AnswerBot, but without the need for artifact-specific data, 
and that some of our proposed techniques perform equivalently well across
multiple artifact types.
