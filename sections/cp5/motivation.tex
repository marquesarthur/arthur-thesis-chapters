\section{Motivation}
\label{cp5:motivation}


When provided with a set of artifacts that potentially contain information relevant to their task,
software developers must inspect the artifact's content and locate the portion of the text that might be relevant to the task-at-hand. 
Some of the artifacts inspected are short enough that a developer can decide if they contain any helpful information at a quick glance.
Some others are lengthy~\cite{Rastkar2013t} and factors such
as high time pressure or
the need to meet deadlines~\cite{meyer2019}
may lead a developer to quickly search the document
in an attempt to find any of the text that is relevant to their task
such that they can 
decide if the artifact is worthy of careful inspection~\cite{Starke2009}.




% often jumps through the sections and the sentences in the text~\cite{Brandt2009a, Starke2009}.
% When doing so,
As unfruitful searches can 
cause a developer to abandon an artifact that could otherwise contain information  helpful to the developer's task~\cite{Brandt2009a, Starke2009},
several studies have proposed automatic approaches to assist this activity. 
For example, both Xu et al.~\cite{Xu2017} and Ponzanelli et al.~\cite{Ponzanelli2015}
argue that sentences relevant to a particular software task might be automatically identified if they have keywords that also appear in a task description.
In turn, Silva et al.~\cite{silva2019} discuss that 
there is a lexical gap between a task description and the information associated 
with the solution for that task, which lead them to identify
relevant sentences based on their semantics.





% When skimming through an artifact's content, a series of intrinsic and extrinsic factors~\cite{Freund2015} 
% serve as indicators of the relevance of the text to the developer's task.
% For example, a code element that is mentioned in a task description 
% and that also appears in a sentence may lead 
% the developer to inspect the sentence more carefully and is an example of an extrinsic factor (i.e., shared keywords).
% The developer's familiarity with the document's structure
% may also guide her to skip certain parts of its content while focusing her attention to others and is 
% an example of an intrinsic factor (i.e., the developer's experience reading a certain type of artifact).





% As Table~\ref{tbl:text-properties-references} shows, many studies have 
% provided possible factors that guide the automatic identification of text relevant to a particular task.
% These factors are used in automatic approaches that help a developer in identifying parts of an artifact worthy of their attention.
% As an example, Krec uses the presence of code elements in a sentence to identify 
% text that programmers cannot afford to ignore when using an API~\cite{Robillard2015}, 
% e.g., ``\textit{Use \hl{getName} to get the logical name of the font}''.
% As another example, Sara and Treude argue that relevant text is often found in sentences
% with usage conditions~\cite{nadi2020}, 
% e.g., ``\textit{\hl{If} the permission you need to add isn't listed under the normal permissions, you'll need to deal with Runtime Permissions}''.

% While the factors outlined in Table~\ref{tbl:text-properties-references} rely on 
% syntactic properties, we hypothesize that one can determine the relevancy of a sentence based on its semantics. 
% More specifically, our study characterizing task-relevant text has shown that certain frames---identifiable through frame semantics~\cite{fillmore1976frame}---are more prominent in sentences deemed as relevant.
% For example, in the sentence about the ``\textit{getName}'' method,
% we can identify frames detailing \texttt{using} the method to achieve a \texttt{goal}:

% \input{sections/cp5/frame-example}


% The \texttt{Using} frame is one of the frames observed in annotations from 20 participants of text deemed as relevant,
%  which among others, contain frames about required events, obligations, actions evoking system calls or executing some procedure.
% Given how these frames capture key factors used to understand a sentence's meaning
% and their prominence in relevant text, 
% we argue that semantic properties can enhance or complement the identification of task-relevant text.
