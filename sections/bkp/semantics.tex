At times, software engineering researchers have argued
that general lexicon techniques 
are insufficient to address text appearing in
software engineering artifacts. 
Arguments on why lexicon-based natural 
language techniques are not applicable are often based
on a need for access to the \textit{meaning}, or semantics, 
of words, phrases or sentences appearing in the text~\cite{jurafsky2014speech}.
In this section, 
we present background information on semantics focusing on
its usage in software engineering research.



\subsection{Word Semantics}

Word semantic techniques are mostly rooted on the hypothesis
that similar words appear in similar context~\cite{harris1954distributional}.
This hypothesis gave origin to a series of
\textit{distributional semantic models}~\cite{Ye2016} that aim to infer the meaning of words.
% In this section, we present prominent models used by software engineering researchers.



Distributional semantic models have been used by software engineering researchers 
to improve the 
the retrieval of artifacts pertinent to a certain task. 
Early models, such as \acf{LSI}~\cite{deerwester1990LSI}, 
have been used to, for example, recover traceability links between source code and
software documentation~\cite{marcus2003}.  
\acs{LSI} takes a initial word representation (i.e., a term by document matrix) and applies \acf{SVD}~\cite{klema1980SVD}
to reduce the dimensionality of this matrix, what causes 
words with similar meaning have the same final representation.


Other word semantic models have assisted software engineering researchers in clustering semantically similar artifacts~\cite{zhang2014, layman2016}. For that, researchers have mostly used
\acf{LDA}~\cite{blei2003latent}---a model that assumes that words used in a similar context often pertain to the same subject to produce topics clustering sentences or documents containing semantically related words---to
identify common themes in developers' blog posts~\cite{Pagano2011} or to design tools that identify duplicated bug reports~\cite{nguyen2012, Thung2014}.


% ---among its many applications~\cite{zhang2014, layman2016}---


% Marcus and Maletic apply \acs{LSI} to 

% In software engineering, \acs{LSI} has been widely used to assist requirements traceability~\cite{lucia2007, hayes2006, gethers2011}.

Despite their significant contributions, early models created word vector representations
by counting the frequency or co-occurrence of words, what is substantially inefficient for large corpora~\cite{Ye2016}.
This and other challenges have been lifted by advancements in the fields of \acf{ML} and \acf{DL}~\cite{ferreira2021, li2018deep}, which walked hand-to-hand with improvements in computational power and the amount of memory available in modern computer architectures~\cite{sharafi2015}.


\acs{DL} models built with \textit{neural, or word, embeddings}~\cite{Mikolov2013} 
are of particular interest to this thesis. 
Neural embeddings produce vector representations in a continuous space 
and researchers have shown that they

\subsection{Sentence Semantics}







Surprisingly 
most of the deep learning approaches applied to software engineering tasks 
focus on source code and 

natural language text has been very shy....



% Semantic-based approaches  build a meaning by establishing relationships between terms,
% for instance words, based on the context in which these terms appear.
% For example
% the terms `\textit{car}' and `\textit{automobile}' are likely to co-occur in different phrases with terms like `\textit{motor}' and `\textit{wheel}' and thus,
% semantic approaches indicate that these terms are likely similar in meaning~\cite{Bavota2016}.

% As an example of the usage of semantics in software engineering researcher, Marcus and Maletic applied Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to help cluster software components to aid
% program comprehension of a software systems~\cite{marcus2003}. 
% Ye et al.'s study on the usage of word embeddings~\cite{Ye2016} was among the first to use the language models in the software engineering domain~\cite{Mikolov2013}. 

% Researchers have also developed approaches
% to interpret the meaning of sentences in
% software engineering documents. 
% Maalej and Robillard have
% developed a knowledge taxonomy~\cite{Maalej2013} using grounded theory to analyze documentation in open-source systems and then, they validated their taxonomy on documentation units sampled from the Java SDK 6 and .NET 4.0.
% Arya et al.'s have determined information types in open-source issue discussions~\cite{Arya2019},  Di Sorbo et al. have created an approach to classify  emails based on a developer's intentions~\cite{Sorbo2015} and
%  Marques et al. have investigated the use of frame semantics~\cite{fillmore1976frame}.
%  The techniques we propose in this paper
%  build on these earlier findings.





% \subsection{Machine Learning Approaches} 


% To bridge lexical gaps, researchers have investigated 
% approaches that leverage the 
% semantic aspects of software artifacts~\cite{Maletic2001, Ye2016}.
% While Section~\ref{cp2:artifact-semantics} provides an overview of semantics 
% in software engineering, this section especifically details how semantics might assist in finding 
% pertinent artifacts. 









%  is an early example of an \acs{IR} method that address \textit{lexical mismatches}.

% These and more advanced approaches 


% or when Nguyen and colleagues
% applied Word2Vec~\cite{mikolov2013word2vec} to support the retrieval of API
% examples~\cite{nguyen2017}.




% While ML approaches are effective in locating pertinent artifacts, a developer still needs to
% manually find the parts within that artifact
% that are relevant to her task~\cite{Cubranic2005}. 







% they have been used 
% for several purposes by software engineering researchers.



% While it is obvious to the human reader that `car' and `automobile' are synonyms and can be used interchangeable,  
% standard \acs{IR}  fail to capture this and other differences\footnote{
%     \textbf{Oxford English dictionary definitions}~\cite{dictionary1989oxford} 
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item \textbf{synonymy:} the fact of two or more words having the same meaning;
%         \item \textbf{polysemy:} the fact of having more than one meaning.
%     \end{itemize}
% }
% that significantly affected the performance of \acs{IR} systems~\cite{DeLucia2012}.
% To address these issues, researchers have proposed a set of word semantic techniques the use statistical models to infer the meaning of words.
